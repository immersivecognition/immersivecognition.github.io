        <h1>The Born in Bradford Study</h1>

<p>The Born in Bradford study is tracking the health and wellbeing of over 13,500 children, and their parents born at Bradford Royal Infirmary between March 2007 and December 2010. The health of these children is being tracked from pregnancy through childhood and into adult life. Studying children from before birth is a powerful way of understanding the many influences that shape our lives. We have been able to include how our parents and our wider family, our genes, the way we choose to live, the local environment, the services we access come together to affect our health and well-being. The information collected from our Born in Bradford families is being used to find the causes of common childhood illnesses, conditions and to explore the mental and social development of this new generation.</p>

<h1>ICON with BiB</h1>

<p>ICON (and the wider PACLAB) are involved with BiB through development of standardised assessment tools used to assess the motor and cognitive abilities of children (for example CKAT).</p>
