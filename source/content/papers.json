        "abstract": "Four experiments investigated the effect of pre-stimulus events on judgements of the subjective duration of tones that they preceded. Experiments 1 to 4 used click trains, flickering squares, expanding circles, and white noise as pre-stimulus events and showed that (a) periodic clicks appeared to “speed up” the pacemaker of an internal clock but that the effect wore off over a click-free delay, (b) aperiodic click trains, and visual stimuli in the form of flickering squares and expanding circles, also produced similar increases in estimated tone duration, as did white noise, although its effect was weaker. A fifth experiment examined the effects of periodic flicker on reaction time and showed that, as with periodic clicks in a previous experiment, reaction times were shorter when preceded by flicker than without."

        "abstract": "A classic effect in the timing field is that “sounds are judged longer than lights”(Goldstone, Boardman & Lhamon, 1959). Recently, judgements for tactile durations have been found to fall between the two (Jones, Poliakoff & Wells, 2009). These modality differences are commonly interpreted within scalar timing theory as the work of a central pacemaker which runs faster for sounds, then vibrations, and slowest for lights (Wearden, Edwards, Fakhri & Percival, 1998). We investigated whether verbal estimates and temporal difference thresholds are correlated within each modality, but found this not to be the case. This suggests that differences in pacemaker speed may not be the main driver for modality differences in thresholds. In addition, we investigated sensory bias as an alternative to the pacemaker explanation, but this was found not to correlate with modality differences in timing.",

Although evidence to date indicates that humans are very effective in learning to adapt to uncertain situations, the nature of the specific cognitive processes involved in the adaptation to uncertainty are still a matter of debate. In this article, we reviewed evidence suggesting that cognitive control processes are at the heart of uncertainty in decision-making contexts. Available evidence suggests that: (1) There is a strong conceptual overlap between the constructs of uncertainty and cognitive control; (2) There is a remarkable overlap between the neural networks associated with uncertainty and the brain networks subserving cognitive control; (3) The perception and estimation of uncertainty might play a key role in monitoring processes and the evaluation of the “need for control”; (4) Potential interactions between uncertainty and cognitive control might play a significant role in several affective disorders.",

        "abstract": "Event-related potentials (ERP) observed in the electroencephalogram (EEG) have traditionally provided neural markers for an array of cognitive phenomena through averaging time-locked amplitudes over many trials. However, it is becoming clear that understanding trial-to-trial variability in neural activity and its behavioral consequences is an important venture in cognitive and systems neuroscience. Recent studies have begun to focus on how fluctuations in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electrophysiological (EEG/MEG) signals are correlated with moment-to-moment fluctuations in behavior (eg, Fox et al., 2005; Pessoa and Padmala, 2005; Mars et al., 2008). Indeed, neural responses can vary in theoretically important ways which may reflect a signature of task-relevant brain-state changes such as a subject’s cognitive “context”(Lutz et al., 2002). As such, focusing on single-trial data can provide a more direct link between neural activity and cognitive processes, such as executive function and decision making (Debener et al., 2006). Examining trial-to-trial variability may provide a unique window for exploring dynamic modulations in the decisionmaking process, which frequently requires computing many variables that inform and optimize the decision (eg, Mulert et al., 2005; Weissman et al., 2006; Esposito et al., 2009). One such variable is prior probability (PP), the prior knowledge of the probability concerning the decision alternatives. This PP must be integrated into the decision-making process to form expectations about which event is the most probable to occur. Behavioral studies have previously shown that PP modulates …",

Following exposure, participants completed a Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ) to assess for nausea, disorientation, and oculomotor disturbances. A user evaluation study of this software was conducted to explore the potential utility of this application.Results: Fifty-seven subjects completed the user testing (34 males and 23 females). Mean age was 48.5 years (range, 21–77 years). Mean acquired work experience of the 35 ophthalmologists (61.40%) included in the group was 15.46 years (range, 1–37 years). Twenty-nine participants were VR-naïve. The SSQ showed a mean total score of 5.8 (SD= 9.44) indicating that the system was well tolerated and produced minimal side effects.

To test this hypothesis, we captured objective measures of interceptive timing in 309 primary school children (5–11 years old), alongside scores for general motor skill and national standardized academic attainment.

Background: Tissue trauma occurs routinely during laparoscopic surgery with potentially severe consequences. As such, it is crucial that a surgeon is able to regulate the pressure exerted by surgical instruments. We propose a novel method to assess the onset of tissue trauma by considering the mechanical response of tissue as it is loaded in real-time. Methods: We conducted a parametric study using a lab-based grasping model and differing load conditions. Mechanical stress-time data were analyzed to characterize the tissue response to grasps.

Smooth arm movements require predictions (inference) about the force-field associated with a workspace. The Free Energy Principle (FEP) suggests that such ‘active inference’ is driven by ‘surprise’. We used these insights to create a formal model that explains why disturbance might help learning. In two experiments, participants undertook a continuous tracking task where they learned how to move their arm in different directions through a novel 3D force field. We compared baseline performance before and after exposure to the novel field to quantify learning. In Experiment 1, the exposure phases (but not the baseline measures) were delivered under three different conditions: (i) robot haptic assistance; (ii) no guidance; (iii) robot haptic disturbance. The disturbance group showed the best learning as our model predicted. Experiment 2 further tested our FEP inspired model. Assistive and/or disturbance forces were applied as a function of performance (low surprise), and compared to a random error manipulation (high surprise). The random group showed the most improvement as predicted by the model. Thus, motor learning can be conceptualised as a process of entropy reduction. Short term motor strategies (e.g. global impedance) can mitigate unexpected perturbations, but continuous movements require active inference about external force-fields in order to create accurate internal models of the external world (motor learning).

        "abstract": "The use of virtual reality (VR) in transport research offers the opportunity to collect behavioural data in a controlled dynamic setting. VR settings are useful in the context of hypothetical situations where real- world data does not exist and/or in situations which involve risk and safety issues making real-world data collection infeasible. Nevertheless, VR studies can contribute to transport-related research only if the behaviour elicited in a virtual environment closely resembles real-world behaviour. Importantly, as VR is a relatively new research tool, the best-practice in terms of the experimental design is still to be established. In this paper, we contribute to a better understanding of the implications of the choice of the experimental setup by comparing cycling behaviour in VR between two groups of participants in similar immersive scenarios – the first group controlling the manoeuvres using a keyboard and the other group riding an instrumented bicycle. We critically compare the speed, acceleration, braking and head movements of the participants in the two experiments. We also collect electroencephalography (EEG) data to compare the alpha wave amplitudes and assess the engagement levels of participants in the two settings. The results demonstrate the ability of VR to elicit behavioural patterns in line with those observed in the real-world and indicate the importance of the experimental design in a VR environment beyond the choice of audio-visual stimuli. The findings will be useful for researchers in designing the experimental setup of the VR for behavioural data collection.",

        "abstract": " Human sensorimotor decision-making has a tendency to get ‘stuck in a rut’, being biased towards selecting a previously implemented action structure (‘hysteresis’). Existing explanations cannot provide a principled account of when hysteresis will occur. We propose that hysteresis is an emergent property of a dynamical system learning from the consequences of its actions. To examine this, 152 participants moved a cursor to a target on a tablet device whilst avoiding an obstacle. Hysteresis was observed when the obstacle moved sequentially across the screen between trials, but not with random obstacle placement. Two further experiments (n = 20) showed an attenuation when time and resource constraints were eased. We created a simple computational model capturing dynamic probabilistic estimate updating that showed the same patterns of results. This provides the first computational demonstration of how sensorimotor decision-making can get ‘stuck in a rut’ through the dynamic updating of its probability estimates.Significance Statement Humans show a bias to select the organisational structure of a recently carried out action, even when an alternative option is available with lower costs. This ‘hysteresis’ is said to be more efficient than creating a new plan and it has been interpreted as a ‘design feature’ within decision-making systems. We suggest such teleological arguments are redundant, with hysteresis being a naturally emergent property of a dynamic control system that evolved to operate effectively in an uncertain and partially observable world.

        "abstract": "“Wisdom comes with age” is an oft-heard expression. It suggests that across development we improve in our ability to make decisions—but evidence for its validity is equivocal. In realworld decision-making, there is an adolescent-specific increased propensity to engage in behaviors associated with morbidity and mortality (eg, road traffic accidents, unprotected sex, violence, drug, and alcohol abuse; Blum and Nelson-Mmari, 2004). However, this inverted u-shape developmental trajectory for risk-taking is typically not observed in laboratory-based studies (Defoe et al., 2015). As such, there exists a need to:(a) bridge the gap between laboratory and real world behavior; and (b) clarify the processes underlying developmental differences in decision-making to inform interventions that target a reduction in health-risking adolescent activities. A recent fMRI study by Van Duijvenvoorde et al.(2015) examined the neural correlates of risk-taking in three maturational periods: childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. Participants from each age group performed a version of the Columbia Card Task (CCT; Figner et al., 2009). In the fMRI-CCT participants are shown up to 16 cards face down per round—each card is associated with a gain or loss of reward and participants are informed about the proportion of cards associated with loss and gain during each round. Participants turn over cards until they either decide to stop or until they turn over a loss card, which ends the round. Loss probability increases with each card selection—as each gain card drawn reduces the proportion of gain cards in the remaining set. This follows a “Risk-Return” approach to …",

Methods: A single-blinded, randomized control study was conducted to com-pare an iPad based e-textbook, coupled with a face to face teaching session; to a face to face teaching session alone. The intervention group had access to the e-textbook before, during and after a face to face teaching session. The control group only received a face to face teaching session. The same educational materials were used for each group. Participants were recorded tying knots immediately following the teaching session and one week later. Performance was assessed by a blinded examiner using the previously validated Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills. Results: The intervention group required significantly less time to perform the knot-tying task in the classroom (p = 0⋅02). Immediately following the teaching session, there was no difference between the control and intervention group at assessment of knot tying (p = 0⋅272). However, after one week, the intervention group performed significantly better than control participants (p=0⋅037). Conclusions: The use of an e-textbook and the reverse classroom was shown to be both more efficient and pervasive at teaching basic knot tying skills than traditional face to face teaching sessions alone. This method of curriculum delivery could easily be expanded to other areas, with significant benefits to the education of students."

For a VR simulation to elicit effective transfer of training to the real-world, it must provide a sufficient level of validity, that is, it must be representative of the real-world skill. In order to develop the most effective simulations, assessments of validity should be carried out prior to implementing simulations in training.Objective: The aim of this work was to test elements of the physical fidelity, psychological fidelity and construct validity of a VR golf putting simulation. Method: Self-report measures of task load and presence in the simulation were taken following real and simulated golf putting to assess psychological and physical fidelity. The performance of novice and expert golfers in the simulation was also compared as an initial test of construct validity.Results: Participants reported a high degree of presence in the simulation and there was little difference between real and virtual putting in terms of task demands. Experts performed significantly better in the simulation than novices (p=. 001, d= 1.23) and there was a significant relationship between performance on the real and virtual tasks (r=. 46, p=. 004). Conclusions: The results indicated that the simulation exhibited an acceptable degree of construct validity and psychological fidelity. However, some differences between the real and virtual tasks emerged, suggesting further validation work is required.",

        "abstract": "Virtual reality (VR) systems hold significant potential for both training and experimentation 1 purposes as they provide precise control over the environment and the possibility to untether 2 tasks from their normal physical constraints. However, the artificial creation of depth in 3 stereoscopic displays, and reduced availability of haptic information, may affect how 4 visually-guided motor tasks are performed in the virtual world. If so, tasks learned in VR may 5 be unrepresentative of real skills, and therefore unlikely to elicit positive transfer to the real-6 world. In Experiment 1 we tested whether learning a visually-guided motor skill (golf 7 putting) in virtual reality could transfer to real-world improvements. Despite the perceptual 8 limitations imposed by the virtual environment, training novice golfers in VR led to 9 improvements in real putting that were comparable to real-world practice. Experiment 2 10 explored these effects in more skilled golfers, and examined changes in gaze behaviour (quiet 11 eye) that resulted from the more immediate use of VR (ie as a tool for ‘warming up’). VR 12 use was found to cause impairments to gaze control (quiet eye) and putting accuracy, when 13 used immediately prior to real world putting. Overall, these findings demonstrate the 14 potential for VR training, but also highlight that fundamental questions remain about how the 15 altered perceptual environment of VR affects visually-guided skills. 16",

Traditionally, perceived risk and its effect on choices have been explored by means of paper or web-based stated preference (SP) surveys or simple laboratory experiments. This is unsatisfactory as the degree to which the risk is experienced may be very understated. Experimental techniques can of course not capture the experience of risk to the same degree as real-life settings, but some headway can be made with augmented and virtual reality technologies. A key component is the dynamic nature of the experiments. Many studies focusing on risk perception have adopted such a more dynamic approach to improve realism and better capture the reactions to momentary changes in risk level on the road and hence potentially also the dynamics of risk perception [eg 1].Existing static models of risk perception are however likely not …"

To explore how the brain responds to these different types of errors, we examined EEG signatures of feedback-related processing while participants performed a simple decision-making task. In Experiment 1, we used a task in which unrewarded outcomes were framed as selection errors, similar to how feedback information is treated in most studies. Consistent with previous work, EEG differences between rewarded and unrewarded trials in the medial frontal negativity (MFN) correlated with behavioral adjustment. In Experiment 2, the task was modified such that unrewarded outcomes could arise from either poor execution or selection. For selection errors, the results replicated that observed in Experiment 1. However, unrewarded outcomes attributed to poor execution produced larger amplitude MFN, alongside an attenuation in activity preceding this component and a subsequent enhanced error positivity (Pe) response in posterior sites. In terms of behavioral correlates, only the degree of the early attenuation and amplitude of the Pe correlated with behavioral adjustment following execution errors relative to reward; the amplitude of the MFN did not correlate with behavioral changes related to execution errors. These results indicate the existence of distinct neural correlates of selection and execution error processing and are consistent with the hypothesis that execution errors can modulate action selection evaluation. More generally, they provide insight into how the brain responds to different classes of error that determine future action …",

        "abstract": "Background: In minimally invasive surgery (MIS), the natural relationship between hand and eye is disrupted, i.e. surgeons typically control tools inserted through the patient’s abdomen while viewing the workspace on a remote monitor, which can be located in a variety of positions. This separates the location of visual feedback from the area in which a motor action is executed. Previous studies suggest that the visual display should be placed directly ahead of the surgeon (i.e. to preserve visual-motor mapping). However, the extent of the impact of this rotation on surgical performance is unknown. Methods: Eighteen participants completed an aiming task on a tablet PC within a surgical box trainer using a laparoscopic tool in a controlled simulated environment. Visual feedback was presented on a remote monitor located at 0°, ±45° and ±90°, with order randomised using the Latin Square method. Results: Movements were significantly slower when the monitor was 90° relative to midline, but spatial accuracy was unaffected by monitor position. Interestingly, the effect of reduced speed in the 90° condition was transient, decreasing over time, suggesting rapid adaptation to the rotation. Conclusions: We conclude that the angle of the visual display in the context of MIS may require a surgeon to adapt to a changed mapping between visual inputs and motor outputs. While this adaptation occurs relatively quickly, it may interfere with skilled actions (e.g. intracorporeal suturing) in complex surgical procedures.",

        "abstract": "Attention underpins many activities integral to a child’s development. However, methodological limitations currently make large-scale assessment of children’s attentional skill impractical, costly and lacking in ecological validity. Consequently we developed a measure of ‘Visual Motor Attention’ (VMA)—a construct defined as the ability to sustain and adapt visuomotor behaviour in response to task-relevant visual information. In a series of experiments, we evaluated the capability of our method to measure attentional processes and their contributions in guiding visuomotor behaviour. Experiment 1 established the method’s core features (ability to track stimuli moving on a tablet-computer screen with a hand-held stylus) and demonstrated its sensitivity to principled manipulations in adults’ attentional load. Experiment 2 standardised a format suitable for use with children and showed construct validity by capturing developmental changes in executive attention processes. Experiment 3 tested the hypothesis that children with and without coordination difficulties would show qualitatively different response patterns, finding an interaction between the cognitive and motor factors underpinning responses. Experiment 4 identified associations between VMA performance and existing standardised attention assessments and thereby confirmed convergent validity. These results establish a novel approach to measuring childhood attention that can produce meaningful functional assessments that capture how attention operates in an ecologically valid context (i.e. attention's specific contribution to visuomanual action).",

A potential explanation for this phenomenon suggests that relative changes from previous reward contingencies can constrain how brain monitoring systems form predictions about future events. In support of this idea, we found that changes per se relative to previous states of learned reward contingencies modulated the Feedback-Related Negativity (FRN), a human brain potential known to index discrepancies between predictions and affective outcomes. Specifically, we observed that environments with a 50% reward probability yielded different FRN patterns according to whether they reflected an improvement or a worsening from a previous environment. Further, we also found that this pattern of results was driven mainly by variations in the amplitude of ERPs to positive outcomes. Overall, these results suggest that relative changes in reward probability from previous learned environments can constrain how neural systems of outcome monitoring formulate predictions about the likelihood of future rewards and nonrewards.",

Recent studies have suggested that the use of electroencephalography-based brain-computer interfaces (BCI) can promote this process. Here, we report the first systematic examination of the literature on the use of BCI-robot systems for the rehabilitation of fine motor skills associated with hand movement and profile these systems from a technical and clinical perspective. A search for January 2010–October 2019 articles using Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, PEDro, PsycINFO, IEEE Xplore and Cochrane Library databases was performed. The selection criteria included BCI-hand robotic systems for rehabilitation at different stages of development involving tests on healthy participants or people who have had a stroke. Data fields include those related to study design, participant characteristics, technical specifications of the system, and clinical outcome measures. 30 studies were identified as eligible for qualitative review and among these, 11 studies involved testing a BCI-hand robot on chronic and subacute stroke patients. Statistically significant improvements in motor assessment scores relative to controls were observed for three BCI-hand robot interventions. The degree of robot control for the majority of studies was limited to triggering the device to perform grasping or pinching movements using motor imagery. Most employed a combination of kinaesthetic and visual response via the robotic device and display screen, respectively, to match feedback to motor imagery. 19 out of 30 studies on BCI-robotic systems for hand rehabilitation report systems at prototype or pre …",

Smooth arm movements require predictions (inference) about the force-field associated with a workspace. The Free Energy Principle (FEP) suggests that such ‘active inference’ is driven by ‘surprise’. We used these insights to create a formal model that explains why disturbance might help learning. In two experiments, participants undertook a continuous tracking task where they learned how to move their arm in different directions through a novel 3D force field. We compared baseline performance before and after exposure to the novel field to quantify learning. In Experiment 1, the exposure phases (but not the baseline measures) were delivered under three different conditions: (i) robot haptic assistance; (ii) no guidance; (iii) robot haptic disturbance. The disturbance group showed the best learning as our model predicted. Experiment 2 further tested our FEP inspired model. Assistive and/or disturbance forces were applied as a function of performance (low surprise), and compared to a random error manipulation (high surprise). The random group showed the most improvement as predicted by the model. Thus, motor learning can be conceptualised as a process of entropy reduction. Short term motor strategies (e.g. global impedance) can mitigate unexpected perturbations, but continuous movements require active inference about external force-fields in order to create accurate internal models of the external world (motor learning). Our findings reconcile research on the relationship between noise, variability, and motor …",

        "abstract": " Human sensorimotor decision-making has a tendency to get ‘stuck in a rut’, being biased towards selecting a previously implemented action structure (‘hysteresis’). Existing explanations cannot provide a principled account of when hysteresis will occur. We propose that hysteresis is an emergent property of a dynamical system learning from the consequences of its actions. To examine this, 152 participants moved a cursor to a target on a tablet device whilst avoiding an obstacle. Hysteresis was observed when the obstacle moved sequentially across the screen between trials, but not with random obstacle placement. Two further experiments (n = 20) showed an attenuation when time and resource constraints were eased. We created a simple computational model capturing dynamic probabilistic estimate updating that showed the same patterns of results. This provides the first computational demonstration of how sensorimotor decision-making can get ‘stuck in a rut’ through the dynamic updating of its probability estimates.Significance Statement Humans show a bias to select the organisational structure of a recently carried out action, even when an alternative option is available with lower costs. This ‘hysteresis’ is said to be more efficient than creating a new plan and it has been interpreted as a ‘design feature’ within decision-making systems. We suggest such teleological arguments are redundant, with hysteresis being a naturally emergent property of a dynamic control system that evolved to operate effectively in an uncertain and partially observable world.

However, the artificial creation of depth in 3 stereoscopic displays, and reduced availability of haptic information, may affect how 4 visually-guided motor tasks are performed in the virtual world. If so, tasks learned in VR may 5 be unrepresentative of real skills, and therefore unlikely to elicit positive transfer to the real-6 world. In Experiment 1 we tested whether learning a visually-guided motor skill (golf 7 putting) in virtual reality could transfer to real-world improvements. Despite the perceptual 8 limitations imposed by the virtual environment, training novice golfers in VR led to 9 improvements in real putting that were comparable to real-world practice. Experiment 2 10 explored these effects in more skilled golfers, and examined changes in gaze behaviour (quiet 11 eye) that resulted from the more immediate use of VR (ie as a tool for ‘warming up’). VR 12 use was found to cause impairments to gaze control (quiet eye) and putting accuracy, when 13 used immediately prior to real world putting. Overall, these findings demonstrate the 14 potential for VR training, but also highlight that fundamental questions remain about how the 15 altered perceptual environment of VR affects visually-guided skills. 16",

        "abstract": "Sensorimotor learning can be defined as a process by which an organism benefits from its experience, such that its future behaviour is better adapted to its environment. Humans are sensorimotor learners par excellence, and neurologically intact adults possess an incredible repertoire of skilled behaviours. Nevertheless, despite the topic fascinating scientists for centuries, there remains a lack of understanding about how humans truly learn. There is a need to better understand sensorimotor learning mechanisms in order to develop treatments for individuals with movement problems, improve training regimes (e.g. surgery) and accelerate motor learning in tasks such as handwriting in children and stroke rehabilitation. This thesis set out to improve our understanding of sensorimotor learning processes and develop methodologies and tools that enable other scientists to tackle these research questions using the power of recent developments in computer science (particularly immersive technologies). Errors in sensorimotor learning are the specific focus of the experimental chapters of this thesis, where the goal is to address our understanding of error perception and correction in motor learning and provide a computational understanding of how we process different types of error to inform subsequent behaviour. A brief summary of the approaches employed, and tools developed over the course of this thesis are presented below. Chapter 1 of this thesis provides a concise overview of the literature on human sensorimotor learning.

To explore how the brain responds to these different types of errors, we examined EEG signatures of feedback-related processing while participants performed a simple decision-making task. In Experiment 1, we used a task in which unrewarded outcomes were framed as selection errors, similar to how feedback information is treated in most studies. Consistent with previous work, EEG differences between rewarded and unrewarded trials in the medial frontal negativity (MFN) correlated with behavioral adjustment. In Experiment 2, the task was modified such that unrewarded outcomes could arise from either poor execution or selection. For selection errors, the results replicated that observed in Experiment 1. However, unrewarded outcomes attributed to poor execution produced larger amplitude MFN, alongside an attenuation in activity preceding this component and a subsequent enhanced error positivity (Pe) response in posterior sites. In terms of behavioral correlates, only the degree of the early attenuation and amplitude of the Pe correlated with behavioral adjustment following execution errors relative to reward; the amplitude of the MFN did not correlate with behavioral changes related to execution errors. These results indicate the existence of distinct neural correlates of selection and execution error processing and are consistent with the hypothesis that execution errors can modulate action selection evaluation. More generally, they provide insight into how the brain responds to different classes of error that determine future action …",

A principal goal of LHCb is to perform flavour physics measurements, and the trigger is designed to distinguish charm and beauty decays from the light quark background. Using a combination of lepton identification and measurements of the particles' transverse momenta the trigger selects particles originating from charm and beauty hadrons, which typically fly a finite distance before decaying. The trigger reduces the roughly 11 MHz of bunch-bunch crossings that contain at least one inelastic pp interaction to 3 kHz. This reduction takes place in two stages; the first stage is implemented in hardware and the second stage is a software application that runs on a large computer farm. A data-driven method is used to evaluate the performance of the trigger on several charm and beauty decay modes.",

In contrast, action theory has long suggested that effective skill acquisition requires movements to be actively generated. Is this true? In view of the former, we explicitly tested the latter. Previously, a method was developed that allows children with Developmental Coordination Disorder to produce effective movements actively, so as to improve manual performance to match that of typically developing children. In the current study, we tested practice using such active movements as compared to practice using passive movement. The passive movement employed, namely haptic tracking, provided a strong test of the comparison, one that showed that the mere inaction of the muscles is not the problem. Instead, lack of prospective control was. The result was no effective learning with passive movement while active practice with prospective control yielded significant improvements in performance.",

Three objects of different widths were placed at three different distances, with objects having either a high or low friction surface (i.e. rough or slippery). Older participants showed quantitative differences to their younger counterparts – movements were slower and peak speed did not scale with object distance. There were also qualitative differences with older adults showing a greater propensity to stop the hand and adjust finger position before lifting objects. The older participants particularly struggled to lift wide slippery objects, apparently due to an inability to manipulate their grasp to provide the level of precision necessary to functionally enclose the object. These data shed light on the nature of age related changes in reaching-to-grasp movements and establish a powerful technique for exploring how different product designs will impact on prehensile behavior.",

Nevertheless, the reported modification is generally partial (reaching is changed less than predicted by the feedback error), a finding that has been ascribed to slow adaptation rates. It is possible, however, that the modified reaching reflects the system's weighting of the visual and haptic information in the presence of noise rather than calibration per se.

We designed the system for a school environment. To assess the feasibility of deploying the system in a school environment, the research team enlisted the help of teachers and staff in nine schools. Once the system was set up, it was used to deliver therapy without supervision from the research team. Ultimately, the system was found to be suitable for use in schools. However, the overriding need for schools to focus on academic activities meant that children could not use the system enough to achieve the amount of use desired for therapeutic benefit. In this paper, we identify the key challenges encountered during this study. For example, there was a marked reluctance to report system issues (which could have been fixed) that prevented children from using the system. We also discuss future implications of deploying similar studies with this type of system.",

They cannot produce movements well enough to improve. Snapp-Childs, Mon-Williams and Bingham (2012) developed a method that supports active movement generation to allow practice with improvement of good compliance control. They showed that the method allowed children with DCD to improve at a 3D tracing task to become as proficient as typically developing children who had also trained. In the present study, we examined the effect of this training on handwriting, specifically figure copying, in 7-8 year olds. Methods: Twenty-three children were tested with the Beery VMI (including tests of Visual Perception (VP) and Motor Coordination (MC)), the 3D tracing task, and a 2D letter-like figure copying task.

A principal goal of LHCb is to perform flavour physics measurements, and the trigger is designed to distinguish charm and beauty decays from the light quark background. Using a combination of lepton identification and measurements of the particles' transverse momenta the trigger selects particles originating from charm and beauty hadrons, which typically fly a finite distance before decaying. The trigger reduces the roughly 11 MHz of bunch-bunch crossings that contain at least one inelastic pp interaction to 3 kHz. This reduction takes place in two stages; the first stage is implemented in hardware and the second stage is a software application that runs on a large computer farm. A data-driven method is used to evaluate the performance of the trigger on several charm and beauty decay modes.",

The DSM-IV-TR precludes a dual-diagnosis of ASD with ADHD and symptoms of attention deficits are not included in the DSM-IV-TR or the ICD-10 diagnosis for ASD. There is currently inconsistent literature surrounding what types of attentional difficulties exist in ASD, if any. As undiagnosed ASDs are suspected to be a leading cause of expulsion from schools (Skuse et al, 2010), the present study aims to explore sustained and divided attentional abilities as they are known to have a relationship with academic performance (Gordon et al, 1994), in children across a continuum of autistic spectrum disorder traits, using a novel objective measure of attention. 80 children (M= 40, F= 40, aged 7-11) were recruited from a primary school in the ‘Born in Bradford’cohort. Sustained attention was measured on tracking and cue-detection tasks on a tablet laptop, and divided attention was measured by performing both tasks together under dual-task conditions. Information was gathered for each child from their main teacher using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (Goodman et al, 2001); three subscales of which have previously been found to represent ASD traits (Iizuka et al, 2010; Russell et al, 2012). Results revealed that sustained and divided attention capacity does appear to be poorer in children who display greater ASD traits. Linear regressions suggest …",

This question is important because of the emphasis placed on developing important new manual skills during this period of a child's education (e.g. writing, drawing, using computers). We investigated age and sex-differences in the ability of 422 children to control a handheld stylus. A task battery deployed using tablet PC technology presented interactive visual targets on a computer screen whilst simultaneously recording participant's objective kinematic responses, via their interactions with the on-screen stimuli using the handheld stylus. The battery required children use the stylus to: (i) make a series of aiming movements, (ii) trace a series of abstract shapes and (iii) track a moving object. The tasks were not familiar to the children, allowing measurement of a general ability that might be meaningfully labelled ‘manual control’, whilst minimising culturally determined differences in experience (as much as possible). A reliable interaction between sex and age was found on the aiming task, with girls' movement times being faster than boys in younger age groups (e.g. 4–5 years) but with this pattern reversing in older children (10–11 years). The improved performance in older boys on the aiming task is consistent with prior evidence of a male advantage for gross-motor aiming tasks, which begins to emerge during adolescence. A small but reliable sex difference was found in tracing skill, with girls showing a slightly higher level of performance than boys irrespective of age. There were no reliable sex differences between boys and girls on …",

This raises the question of the strength of the empirical relationship between measures of postural stability and manual motor control. We recorded objective computerised measures of postural stability in stance and manual control in sitting in a sample of school children (n = 278) aged 3–11 years in order to explore the extent to which measures of manual skill could be predicted by measures of postural stability.

We found that baseline performance in 3D tracing and drawing co-varied with the visual perception (VP) component of the Beery.

It is currently preparing to release its user programme for exploiting fragment screening using X-ray crystallography in structural medicinal chemistry projects. For this purpose, the beamline has been going through several upgrades in order to achieve unattended highthroughput ligand crystallography. The new developments are aiming at improving the flux, stability and reliability of the beamline and its auto-alignment. In parallel, a peripheral laboratory is being set up to provide a facility for medium throughput compound soaking.

Our understanding of the history of the Denmark Strait Overflow Water (DSOW) is significantly less constrained and yet it accounts for half of the total overflow production today.

Previously, we developed a training method that supports active movement generation to allow improvement at a 3D tracing task requiring good compliance control. Here, we tested 7–8 year old children from several 2nd grade classrooms to determine whether 3D tracing performance could be predicted using the Beery VMI. We also examined whether 3D tracing training lead to improvements in drawing. Baseline testing included Beery, a drawing task on a tablet computer, and 3D tracing. We found that baseline performance in 3D tracing and drawing co-varied with the visual perception (VP) component of the Beery. Differences in 3D tracing between children scoring low versus high on the Beery VP replicated differences previously found between children with and without motor impairments, as did post-training performance that eliminated these differences. Drawing improved as a result of training in the 3D tracing task. The training method improved drawing and reduced differences predicted by Beery scores."

These tests are used generally to explore ocular-motor status before and after using a particular virtual environment (VE) system for a given period of time. Finally, a different approach to investigating the impact of VE systems on the ocular-motor system is discussed. This final section describes experimental results that highlight some interesting features of the ocular-motor system.

        "abstract": "Concerns associated with livestock production have contributed to conflict in communities across rural North America (Grey, 2000; Caldwell, 2001). Real and perceived environmental, social, and economic issues related to the intensification of livestock production have led governments at the municipal, provincial/state and federal level to respond (Edelman et. al., 1998; Henderson, 1998; Caldwell and Toombs, 1999). In the United States large scale livestock operations tend to be referred to as CAFO’s (Confined Animal Feeding Operation’s) and in Canada they are known by a variety of names including Intensive Livestock Operations (ILO’s) or Confined Feeding Operations (CFO’s). The debate associated with the establishment of these facilities has led to an equal amount of debate concerning the nature of government response.From an environmental perspective the focus of attention has been on issues related to odour and water quality. In many jurisdictions including Ontario, Alberta and Manitoba municipalities have attempted to regulate the industry through a variety of strategies including nutrient management plans, conditional use permits (including public meetings), restrictive zoning, and caps limiting the size of these facilities (Caldwell and Toombs, 1999). In some respects, however, municipal involvement has led to what has been referred to as a “patchwork quilt” of differing regulations across the province or state. Moreover, municipalities have often been challenged by issues of enforcement, fairness and local politics. The result is that issues have often been lost in the ferocity of",

Complementary studies have begun to explore what binocular information is used and how this information is exploited by the human nervous system. The present series of experiments was conducted in order to explore further when binocular information is advantageous in prehension. Three experiments were employed which varied binocular/monocular viewing in selectively lit conditions. Our research suggests that the nature of the advantage conferred by binocular vision depends upon task conditions. One constant advantage of binocular vision appears to be in its provision of on-line information regarding the position of the hand relative to the target.

Twenty adult subjects (aged 19–29 years) wore a commercially available HMD for 10 min while cycling around a computer generated 3‐D world. The twin screen presentations were set lo suit the average interpupillary distance of our subject population, to mimic the conditions of public access virtual reality systems. Subjects were examined before and after exposure to the HMD and there were clear signs of induced binocular stress for a number of the subjects. The implications of introducing such HMDs into the workplace and entertainment environments are discussed.",

We discuss the extent to which VR may be a useful tool in visualization and attempt to disambiguate the use of VR as a general descriptor for any three-dimensional computer presentation. The argument is presented that, to warrant the use of the term virtual environment (VE), the display should satisfy criteria that arise from the nature of human spatial perception. It directly follows, therefore, that perceptual criteria are the foundations of an effective VE display. We address the task of making a VE system easy to navigate, traverse and engage, by examining the ways in which three-dimensional perception and perception of motion may be supported, and consider the potential conflict that may arise between depth cues. We propose that the design of VE …",

Binocular, pattern onset VEPs were recorded in 14 children with DCD aged between five and seven years, and an agematched control group using pattern onset, high contrast, grating stimuli. Implicit times to the first and second peaks and troughs were measured, and results between the two groups were compared.

The present study evaluates various ceramic powders for use in 0-3 composites, the main aim being to enable the use of lower poling voltages by the identification of suitable low-coercivity materials."

Successful design relies on technological development, but design must also consider the physiology and perception of the human user. When creating a virtual environment display, designers must therefore determine the exact VE task requirements. A human-centred approach must then be adopted to ensure that the display meets known human factor constraints, whilst a task-specific approach must formally appraise the perceptual and physiological demands required by the environment in order to maximise system performance whilst minimising problems to the human user."

Three optical devices were employed to explore whether participants (n = 5) could be trained to utilise different information when estimating time to contact of an approaching ball. A pendulum was used to project a ball at three different velocities. Performance was measured using an IR‐based tracking system (Selspot), and an IR eye‐tracker (Ober2) was used to monitor vergence. Cyclopean spectacles (which remove disparity information) were used to train participants. Pre‐ and post‐training performance was compared with performance in telestereoscopes (these double binocular disparity at near), and spectacles that control for …"

A search for January 2010–October 2019 articles using Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, PEDro, PsycINFO, IEEE Xplore and Cochrane Library databases was performed. The selection criteria included BCI-hand robotic systems for rehabilitation at different stages of development involving tests on healthy participants or people who have had a stroke. Data fields include those related to study design, participant characteristics, technical specifications of the system, and clinical outcome measures. 30 studies were identified as eligible for qualitative review and among these, 11 studies involved testing a BCI-hand robot on chronic and subacute stroke patients. Statistically significant improvements in motor assessment scores relative to controls were observed for three BCI-hand robot interventions. The degree of robot control for the majority of studies was limited to triggering the device to perform grasping or pinching movements using motor imagery. Most employed a combination of kinaesthetic and visual response via the robotic device and display screen, respectively, to match feedback to motor imagery. 19 out of 30 studies on BCI-robotic systems for hand rehabilitation report systems at prototype or pre …",

The EYFSP assesses a range of abilities at school entry including academic, language, socio-emotional, and motor skills. In particular, we examined whether the assessment predicted reading, writing, maths, and science ability two years later and special educational needs (SEN) status (N= 5,833–8,352). Children who reached a good level of development had higher odds of performing at expected (vs. below expected) levels on later academic assessments. This was particularly true for children with SEN. Reaching a good level of development also increased the odds of performing at above expected (vs. expected) levels on the academic assessments and lowered the odds of requiring SEN support. This demonstrates that holistic school readiness evaluations are powerful tools that can identify ‘at-risk children’.",

        "abstract": "Background: Socio-economic, cultural and environmental conditions strongly affect health across the life course. Local government plays a key role in influencing these wider determinants of health and levels of inequality within their communities. However, they lack the research infrastructure and culture that would enable them to develop an evidence-based approach to tackling the complex drivers of those conditions.   Methods: We undertook a scoping project to explore the potential for, and what would be needed to develop a local authority research system for the City of Bradford, UK. This included identifying the current research landscape and any barriers and enablers to research activity within the local authority using qualitative individual and focus group interviews, a rapid review of existing local research system models, scoping of the use of evidence in decision making and training opportunities and existing support for local government research.   Results: We identified four key themes important to developing and sustaining a research system: leadership, resource and capacity, culture, partnerships. Some use of research in decision making was evident but research training opportunities within the local authority were limited. Health research funders are slowly adapting to the local government environment, but this remains limited and more work is needed to shift the centre of gravity towards public health, local government and the community more generally.    Conclusions: We propose a model for a local authority research system that can guide the development of an exemplar whole system research framework that includes research …",

The Beetle readout chip was developed for the LHCb (Large Hadron Collider beauty) tracking detectors and was used in the VELO (Vertex Locator) during Run 1 and 2 of LHC data taking. The VELO, surrounding the LHC beam crossing region, was a leading part of the LHCb tracking system. The Beetle chip was used to read out the signal from silicon microstrips, integrating and amplifying it. The studies presented in this paper cover the optimization of its electronic configuration to achieve the lower power consumption footprint and the lower operational temperature of the sensors, while maintaining a good condition of the analogue response of the whole chip. The studies have shown that optimizing the operational temperature is possible and can be beneficial when the detector is highly irradiated. Even a single degree drop in silicon temperature can result in a significant reduction in the leakage current. Similar studies are being performed for the future silicon tracker, the Upstream Tracker (UT), which will start operating at LHC in 2021. It is expected that the inner part of the UT detector will suffer radiation damage similar to the most irradiated VELO sensors in Run 2. In the course of analysis we also developed a general approach for the pulse shape reconstruction using an ANN approach. This technique can be reused in case of any type of front-end readout chip.",

Interventions that improve air quality are therefore urgently needed not only to improve public health now, but to prevent longer-term increased vulnerability to chronic disease. Low Emission Zones are a public health policy intervention aimed at reducing traffic-derived contributions to urban air pollution, but evidence that they deliver clear health benefits is lacking. We established a natural experiment design study (CHILL: Children9s Health in London and Luton) to evaluate the impacts of the introduction of London9s Ultra Low Emission Zone (ULEZ) on childrens health. Methods and analysis: CHILL is a prospective two-arm parallel longitudinal cohort study of children aged 6-9 years, attending primary schools in Central London (the focus of the first phase of the ULEZ) and Luton (a comparator site). The primary goal of the study is to examine the impact of changes in annual air pollutant exposures as oxides of nitrogen, nitrogen dioxide, particulate matter less than 2.5microns and 10microns (NOx, NO2, PM2.5, PM10 respectively) across the two sites on lung growth, measured as forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC), over four consecutive years.

As vertical gaze angle is raised or lowered the ‘effort’ required of the binocular system also changes. The extent to which changes in vertical gaze angle alter the demands placed upon the vergence eye movement system was explored. The results suggested that visual stress may depend, in part, on vertical gaze angle.

In contrast, an increase in perceived egocentric distance was largely attenuated by the presence of limb proprioception in reduced visual cue conditions. We conclude that the relative contribution of vergence to perceived distance depends upon the strength of the vergence effort signal when there are other cues present.

Despite this, no model currently exists to explain how the signals which arise through oculomotor control contribute to perception. This paper attempts to provide such a framework. The first part of the paper outlines the framework [the cyclopean equilibrium point (EP) model] and considers the binoculus or cyclopean eye from the perspective of a current account of motor control (the EP hypothesis). An existing model is used to describe how the nervous system could utilise available efference copy and afferent extra retinal signals when determining the direction and distance of cyclopean fixation. Although the cyclopean EP model is speculative, it allows for a …",

When additional depth and distance cues are added, the contribution of vergence information becomes more complicated.

The children with DCD in this study were significantly poorer than control children on all matching tasks.

In principle, prehension might be more accurate with binocular rather than monocular vision. Previous studies have shown that the kinematics of prehension are altered when one eye is covered. Unfortunately, the source of the useful binocular information cannot be established using this approach. In the current study, we used a perturbation technique to explore whether the human nervous system uses a signal from vergence in prehension. Perturbing vergence caused predictable changes in the kinematics of prehension. Our results thus provide clear evidence that the nervous system uses vergence information in the programming of prehensile movement."

The size-distance paradox has been posited as evidence that the perceived distance of a fixated object is, in turn, influenced by the object’s perceived size. If this is correct then it challenges a widely accepted account (modified weak fusion) of how the nervous system combines multiple sources of information. We hypothesised that the influence of perceived size on the perception of distance is likely to be restricted to conscious perceptual judgements. If our hypothesis is correct then the size-distance paradox should not be observed when observers make action-based distance judgements. In line with this expectation we observed the size-distance paradox when participants made verbal reports on target distance but found no paradoxical judgements in a group who were asked to point at the target.

        "abstract": "  We used a perturbation technique to quantify the contribution of visual size cues to the programming of target force when lifting an object. Our results indicate that the nervous system attaches a reasonable weight to visual size cues when programming the target grip force for a novel object. In a subsequent lift of the same object, however, the confidence attached to the visual size cue fell dramatically. It is not clear whether the decrease in the use of size information was accelerated by the presence of a cue conflict or whether the fall represents the normal shift towards the use of a memory-based representation for programming grip force. In a second experiment, we used the \"size-weight illusion\" to explore the relationship between the verbal report of an object's weight and the programming of the grip and load force.

The visuomotor account supposes that the system independently controls the grip formation and transport phase of prehensile movements. In contrast, the digit channel hypothesis suggests that the system controls the thumb and finger more or less independently. Our data strongly favoured the traditional visuomotor channel hypothesis and demonstrated that the time taken to grasp an object in the presence of obstacles was well predicted by a Fitts' law relationship. We suggest a \"third-way\" hypothesis in order to retain the advantages of the digit channel hypothesis within the visuomotor framework. The third-way hypothesis suggests that the nervous system selects a single digit to transport to the object.

Whether these ratios are stable entities, genetically determined, or modifiable by experience has been the subject of some debate. A ‘Virtual Reality’ stimulus was used to place unequal demands on the vergence and accommodation systems. Pre-task and post-task measures of AC/A and CA/C were objectively determined. The changes in the post-task measures are discussed with reference to a dual interactive model of vergence and accommodation.

On the other hand, the prevalence of ophthalmic disorders in people with DS is far higher when comparisons are made with general population norms (eg, Woodhouse, 1998). It is widely accepted that the primary purpose of vision is to enable actionit may be possible to have perception without action (see Milner & Goodale, 1995), but it is not possible to have skilled (learned) action in the absence of perception. If vision is one of the primary senses that underpins skilled movement, then it seems reasonable to posit that deficits in movement may be linked to ocular dysfunction. We suggest, however, that although poor eyesight may impact motor control in people with DS, it is important to avoid the temptation of inferring a causal relation between ocular disorder and movement dysfunction. We have previously argued that a distinction must be made between processes that may underpin control (the process approach) and modules that must be implicated in coordination (Wann, Mon-Williams, & Carson, 1998). Despite the everyday nature of many tasks (eg, picking up an object), successful task completion may require a complex interaction of various skills. If we are to understand why complex skills break down, it is necessary to determine the essential components that allow for successful task completion. It is also necessary to assess what information is perceptually available to someone demonstrating poor movement control in order to determine whether a poorly coordinated movement is an adequate response to inadequate information, an inadequate response to …"

Such changes in populations correspond to very small effects on thermodynamics or kinetics of reactions. Consequently, detailed characterization of protein interactions is of paramount importance in a quantitative and integrative biology, which aims to understand biological systems in terms of their molecular components.Further, interfering with the interactions of proteins is the dominant strategy in the development of new pharmaceuticals.

To investigate this issue, we examined how the feedback-related negativity (FRN) is modulated by information briefly presented before outcome evaluation.

The possibility that tDCS could assist in rehabilitation (eg, for paresis post-stroke) offers hope but the evidence base is incomplete, with some behavioural studies reporting no effect of tDCS on complex motor learning. Older adults who show age-related decline in movement and learning (skills which tDCS could potentially facilitate), are also under-represented within tDCS literature. To address these issues, we examined whether tDCS would improve motor sequence learning in healthy young and older adults. Methods: In Experiment One, young participants learned 32 aiming movements using their preferred (right) hand whilst receiving:(i) 30 min Anodal Stimulation of left M1;(ii) 30 min Cathodal Stimulation of right M1; or (iii) 30 min Sham. Experiment Two used a similar task, but with older adults receiving Anodal Stimulation or Sham. Results: Whilst motor learning occurred in all participants, tDCS did not improve the rate or accuracy of motor learning for either age group. Conclusion: Our results suggest that the effects of tDCS may be limited to motor performance with no clear beneficial effects for motor learning. View Full-Text",

Our aim was to explore the integrity of saccadic eye movement control in developmental coordination disorder (DCD) and typically developing (TD) children (8–12 years) and assess how these children plan and inhibit saccadic responses, the principal mechanisms within visual attention control. Eye movements and touch responses were measured (separately and concurrently) in Cued and Non-Cued conditions. We found that children with DCD had similar saccade kinematics to the TD group during saccade initiation. Advance information decreased hand movement duration in both groups during Cued trials, but decrements in accuracy were significantly worse in the DCD group. In addition, children with DCD exhibited greater inhibitory errors and inaccurate fixation during the Cued trials. Thus, children with DCD were reasonably proficient in executing saccades during reflexive (Non-Cued) conditions, but showed deficits in more complex control processes involving prediction and inhibition. These findings have implications for our understanding of motor control in children with DCD.",

Haptic robotic interventions, based on the principles of sensorimotor learning, have been shown previously to help children with motor problems learn new movements. We therefore examined whether the training benefits of a robotic system would generalise to a standardised test of ‘pen-skills’, assessed using objective kinematic measures [via the Clinical Kinematic Assessment Tool, CKAT]. A counterbalanced, cross-over design was used in a group of 51 children (37 male, aged 5–11 years) with manual control difficulties. Improved performance on a novel task using the robotic device could be attributed to the intervention but there was no evidence of generalisation to any of the CKAT tasks. The robotic system appears to have the potential to support motor learning, with the technology affording numerous advantages. However, the training regime may need to target particular manual skills (e.g. letter formation) in order to obtain clinically significant improvements in specific skills such as handwriting.",

        "abstract": "Background: In minimally invasive surgery (MIS), the natural relationship between hand and eye is disrupted, i.e. surgeons typically control tools inserted through the patient’s abdomen while viewing the workspace on a remote monitor, which can be located in a variety of positions. This separates the location of visual feedback from the area in which a motor action is executed. Previous studies suggest that the visual display should be placed directly ahead of the surgeon (i.e. to preserve visual-motor mapping). However, the extent of the impact of this rotation on surgical performance is unknown. Methods: Eighteen participants completed an aiming task on a tablet PC within a surgical box trainer using a laparoscopic tool in a controlled simulated environment. Visual feedback was presented on a remote monitor located at 0°, ±45° and ±90°, with order randomised using the Latin Square method. Results: Movements were significantly slower when the monitor was 90° relative to midline, but spatial accuracy was unaffected by monitor position. Interestingly, the effect of reduced speed in the 90° condition was transient, decreasing over time, suggesting rapid adaptation to the rotation. Conclusions: We conclude that the angle of the visual display in the context of MIS may require a surgeon to adapt to a changed mapping between visual inputs and motor outputs. While this adaptation occurs relatively quickly, it may interfere with skilled actions (e.g. intracorporeal suturing) in complex surgical procedures.",

However, methodological limitations currently make large-scale assessment of children’s attentional skill impractical, costly and lacking in ecological validity. Consequently we developed a measure of ‘Visual Motor Attention’ (VMA)—a construct defined as the ability to sustain and adapt visuomotor behaviour in response to task-relevant visual information. In a series of experiments, we evaluated the capability of our method to measure attentional processes and their contributions in guiding visuomotor behaviour. Experiment 1 established the method’s core features (ability to track stimuli moving on a tablet-computer screen with a hand-held stylus) and demonstrated its sensitivity to principled manipulations in adults’ attentional load. Experiment 2 standardised a format suitable for use with children and showed construct validity by capturing developmental changes in executive attention processes. Experiment 3 tested the hypothesis that children with and without coordination difficulties would show qualitatively different response patterns, finding an interaction between the cognitive and motor factors underpinning responses. Experiment 4 identified associations between VMA performance and existing standardised attention assessments and thereby confirmed convergent validity. These results establish a novel approach to measuring childhood attention that can produce meaningful functional assessments that capture how attention operates in an ecologically valid context (i.e. attention's specific contribution to visuomanual action).",

Prehension, the ability to reach-grasp-and-manipulate objects, is one of the most important human capabilities. Numerous activities of daily living (dressing, feeding, cleaning etc.) rely on dexterity, so it is perhaps unsurprising that impairment of prehension (through illness, injury or ageing decline) is often associated with disability. The kinematics of reach-to-grasp movements show high levels of stereotypicality in neurologically intact adults whilst impairment …"

Abstract below: Miles, Nind and Macrae (2010) reported findings to suggest that our ability to mentally represent the past and future might be represented in the sensorimotor systems that govern human motor control. They ran an experiment showed participants to lean forward when thinking of the future and lean backward when thinking of the past. We aimed to explore this phenomenon further; firstly by exploring whether the knee would move in the opposite direction to the head when participants were standing (ie an automatic counterbalancing movement to avoid instability). We also applied the same methodology as reported by Miles et al.(2010) in an attempt to replicate their results. Findings demonstrated that found that the head does indeed move in the opposite direction to the knee, but more interestingly, our second experiment actually failed replicate Miles et al's (2010) original findings. Our data strongly suggest that the sensorimotor system prioritises the maintaining of postural control postural maintenance even when a standing individual is engaged in abstract thought processes. This strategy seems the most conducive to survival, given that this approach reduces the likelihood of falls.",

We used six different thyroid cell lines, human primary cultures and SCID mouse xenograft models to explore how PDGFRa alters follicular cell differentiation as defined by TTF1, Pax8 expression and iodide transport. Confocal microscopy, invasion assays and 3D culture defined TTF1 subcellular targeting and cell phenotype. Immunohistochemistry on patient tissue arrays (n= 287) with matching clinical data (follow-up period 11 years) were used to map out recurrence rates as a function of PDGFRa and cytoplasmic TTF1 expression. We reveal that PDGFRa has a unique role in driving aggressive disease in PTC through a double-hit on follicular cells. First, PDGFRa specifically drives dedifferentiation by disrupting the transcriptional activity of TTF1. PDGFRa activation …",

It has been estimated that in 2014, about 52,630 new cases of endometrial cancer was diagnosed and about 8,590 died from the disease. Prior to 1988, endometrial cancer was staged clinically. Since that time surgical staging has been adopted. With the advancement in technology, the vast majority of cases are being staged and treated surgically via minimally invasive approaches. Conventional laparoscopy has been a major advancement in staging and treatment of uterine cancers. However, technical challenges such as 2–D imaging, rigid instruments, and lack of precision and surgeon fatigue did not translate into widespread adoption of this technique. With the advent of computer–enhanced robotic telesurgery, this has dramatically changed the surgical management and staging of endometrial cancer.",

Differential branching fraction measurements are reported in five bins of the invariant mass squared of the dimuon system, q2, between 0.1 and 8.0 GeV2/c4. For the first time, an angular analysis sensitive to the S-, P-and D-wave contributions of this rare decay is performed.

        "abstract": "The interactions and decays of particles containing a charm quark provide a unique testing ground for the standard model (SM), with sensitivity to discover new physics contributions currently inaccessible in direct searches. The neutral charm meson is the only up-type quark system which can exhibit flavour oscillations, which are heavily suppressed in the SM by a combination of GIM and CKM effects [1–3]. While oscillations are well established in the B and K systems, they have not yet been directly observed in D mesons (ie, the measured mass difference is still consistent with zero)[4, 5]. On the other hand, the cancellation of SM amplitudes leads to predictions for chargeparity (CP) violation in oscillation which are both very small and precisely determined (see, eg Ref.[6]), giving high sensitivity to possible contributions from new physics effects. Furthermore, while CP violation in particle decay has been seen in several B and K channels, there is still no evidence for any such effects in the charm sector. As such, it is very important to provide new, precise measurements of charm oscillations and CP violation. The LHCb experiment is ideally suited for this task. For a theoretical overview of the topic, please see the proceedings from this conference (and references therein) from G. Martinelli and M. Ciuchini. Here I focus on the new and recent experimental results.The LHCb detector [7, 8] is a single-arm forward spectrometer covering the pseudorapidity range 2< η< 5, designed for the study of particles containing b or c quarks.

According to the allocation, surgeons will undergo the following; group (i) SMR with virtual reality 3D-models, group (ii) SMR with virtual and physical 3D-models (including simulation), and group (iii) SMR with standard MR scans. The primary outcome of this study is surgical performance (Competency Assessment tool) and the secondary is patient outcomes. Pilot data: As “proof of concept” surgical performance after SMR with 3D models and after watching a didactic video was compared. Surgeons who performed SMR using a 3D model performed significantly better (number of movements-553 vs. 1391.5, p= 0.005, total path length of instrument tip 1540.24 vs. 2837 p= 0.007 and time 667 s, vs. 1283s, p= 0.003). Forward plan: Patient specific SMR with the use of 3D models, is expected to increase quality of surgery and specimen and reduce operative complications. The results of this study will create a strong impetus for widespread use of patient-specific SMR.

        "abstract": " Previous research has suggested that binocular vision plays an important role in prehension. It has been shown that removing binocular vision affects (negatively) both the planning and on-line control of prehension. It has been suggested that the adverse impact of removing binocular vision is because monocular viewing results in an underestimation of target distance in visuomotor tasks. This suggestion is based on the observation that the kinematics of prehension are altered when viewing monocularly. We argue that it is not possible to draw unambiguous conclusions regarding the accuracy of distance perception from these data. In experiment 1, we found data that contradict the idea that a consistent visuomotor underestimation of target distance is an inevitable consequence of monocular viewing. Our data did show, however, that positional variance increases under monocular viewing. We provide an …",

This problem was attributed to a putative difference between the visual processing of size and distance in the brain, whereby DF retained the capacity for processing object size but not the separation between distinct elements such as holes. In the present study we have tested this idea more directly, and found no evidence to support such a distinction.

The fact that there is flexibility in the relationship between vision and the kinesthetically controlled motor system raises the question as to how labile is this relation? We used distorted haptic feedback from reaches to alter the calibration of perceived distance and to progressively dissociate the visual location from the location to which participants reached to touch the visually presented object.

Virtual reality (VR) systems present computer graphics within a viewer-centred frame of reference in order to recreate the visual array. VR systems are potentially powerful tools for studying perception in prehension as they afford precise control over all visual information and allow one to perturb the information in ways that are restricted by Newtonian laws within the physical world. Nonetheless, VR systems do not appear to have fully realised their potential. One major reason for the limitations of VR in prehension research is that people do not appear to show the same levels of performance when reaching-to-grasp virtual items as they evidence when grasping physical objects. One possible explanation for reduced performance in unnatural prehension tasks hinges around the need for the nervous system to …"

We decided to explore an interceptive timing task in an attempt to determine if motor deficits, per se, exist in children with ASD.

Diagnosis of DCD was confirmed for 29 children by the Movement Assessment Battery for Children (ABC); 29 control children were randomly selected. Comprehensive examination with a battery of ophthalmic tests did not reveal any significant difference in visual status between the two groups. Strabismus was found in 5 children from both groups. All 5 children with strabismus from the DCD group showed a similar movement profile with the Motor Competence Checklist. While a causal relationship cannot be discounted, the presence of strabismus …"

The time it takes one hand to move to a target in a simple aiming task can be predicted reliably from Fitts' law, which states that movement time is a function of a combined measure of amplitude and accuracy constraints (the index of difficulty, ID). It has been assumed previously that Fitts' law is violated in bimanual aiming movements to targets of unequal ID. We present data from two experiments to show that this assumption is incorrect: if the attention demands of a bimanual aiming task are constant then the movements are well described by a Fitts' law relationship. Movement time therefore depends not only on ID but on other task conditions, which is a basic feature of Fitts' law. In a third experiment we show that eye movements are an important determinant of the …",

This study addressed four outstanding questions regarding how the nervous system adjusts arm movements in response to target displacement. A double-step paradigm was used with participants required to move to a target that changed its starting position (46cm along the midline) 10ms after movement initiation on 50% of trials (perturbation condition). The data from the trials where the target did not jump were compared to identical trials from a subsequent condition where the target was never displaced (non-perturbation).Results. We discovered differences in the spatial path between conditions (presumed to be strategic) but the temporal characteristics of the movement were unaltered.

Current methods of measuring human kinematics range from accurate but multifarious laboratory configurations to portable but simplistic and time-consuming paper and pen methods. We describe a new system for recording the end-point of human movement that has the power of laboratory measures but the advantages of pen-and-paper tests: the Kinematic Assessment Tool.

Adult participants reached and grasped a cylinder positioned to require either pronation or supination of the hand. Successive cylinder positions changed either randomly or systematically between trials. Random positioning led to optimized economy of movement. In contrast, systematic changes in position biased action selection toward previously selected actions at the expense of movement economy. Thus, one switches to a new movement only when the savings outweigh the costs of the switch. Immediate movement history had an even larger influence on children aged 7-15 years. This suggests that switching costs are greater in children, which is consistent with their reduced grasping experience. The presence of this effect in adults suggests that …",

In eight conditions, the task required concurrent rotation of the lower arm (180° pronation/supination). Movements were stereotypical within a condition but plotting the upper and lower arm angle against each other produced an asymmetrical pattern. With internal rotation, the upper arm reached peak angular velocity slower than the lower arm but this was reversed with external rotation. In two conditions, participants were asked to move faster and slower than their normal speed. The peak speed, time to peak speed and duration were predictable for the different tasks. Internal and external asymmetries decreased with faster movements. In addition a …"

        "abstract": "The history of drug discovery spans some 200,000 years. For much of this time the identification of therapeutic agents was empirical, with the shift to a more hypothesis-driven approach occurring in the late 19th century. Since then, the objective has changed from identifying an active drug and then its mechanism of action, to determining therapeutic potential only after identifying drug-like compounds that interact with a target site. While the emphasis on target identification, or targephilia, has yielded novel drugs, overall it appears to have slowed the drug discovery process, especially for compounds used to treat central nervous system (CNS) disorders. This is because the targephilic approach requires a good understanding of target physiology and its integration with the target organ, with a hierarchical integration from in vitro cellular and functional tissue studies to animal models that reasonably predict human responses. As the majority of CNS drugs were discovered empirically, drug discovery in this area appears less amenable to target-based approaches than for other types of therapeutics. Improving the success rate in CNS drug discovery requires a more pharmacometric-based approach with a renewed emphasis on defining basic CNS function in intact animals and a more systematic in vivo screening of novel structures. Efforts must also be directed towards defining the sites of action of existing CNS drugs to aid in the design of second-generation agents with improved efficacy and safety."

In both cases, participants generated trajectories within the boundaries of a delineated path. When tracing, the participants used a handheld stylus to follow a sinusoidal shape displayed on a tablet laptop. When steering, participants used a steering-wheel to change their locomotor direction to match a perspective-correct computer-generated sinusoidal roadway (see Wilkie & Wann, 2003).

Our poor understanding is particularly worrying because falls have been reported as the primary cause of premature death in older persons (Sattin, 1992). Standing balance is a reasonable predictor of increased risk of falling (Jarnlo, 2003, Winter et al., 1990). Nonetheless, many falls occur when someone is engaged in a visuomotor task (eg putting a key in a lock) rather than simply standing upright.

We tested this idea in two studies involving patients with visual form agnosia resulting from bilateral ventral-stream damage.

        "abstract": "The purpose of this chapter is to consider imitation and autism spectrum disorders (ASD) from the context of research into skilled movement. We suggest that studies investigating “imitation” must identify the level of representation required for success in the imitation task. We provide an overview of techniques for measuring skilled movement (using aiming and prehension movements as an example) and highlight the value of kinematic measurement techniques for precise quantification of imitation behavior. We discuss a study indicating that movement control per se is not necessarily impaired in ASD and speculate on why imitation deficits might lie at the heart of autism."

The tasks provided objective performance measures that tested previous claims based on subjective observations regarding autism. We found that children with autism: (i) were indistinguishable from controls in their form and motion coherence thresholds; (ii) were indistinguishable in their ability to detect subtle changes in realistic dynamic face stimuli; (iii) were indistinguishable in an imitation task requiring tracking a simple rhythmic movement; (iv) showed idiosyncratic differences in a joint attention task. In the joint attention task, targets moved around four corners of a screen during a 90 s video. Three conditions were explored: (i) a technician's head displayed in the middle of the screen (baseline); (ii) the head moved congruently with target position; (iii) the head moved incongruently. The movement execution of the autistic group was indistinguishable from the controls but there were differences in reaction time. The children with autism fell into one of three groups: (i) normal; (ii) slower RT with congruent head movement; (iii) slower RT with incongruent head movement. We suggest that 'sticky attention' in autism can reconcile our laboratory findings with clinical observations."

Postulated empirical support for this ‘ideo-motor (IM) conjecture’ typically rests upon two types of experimental paradigm (reaction time and movement tracking tasks). These paradigms purport to show movement facilitation when compatible movements are observed and vice versa, but only for biological stimuli. Unfortunately, these paradigms often contain confounding (and unavoidable) generic stimulus–response compatibility effects that are not restricted to observed human movement. The current study demonstrates in three experiments that equivalent compatibility effects can be produced by non-biological stimuli. These results suggest that existing empirical paradigms may not, and perhaps cannot, support the IM-conjecture.",

Evidence supporting the case for an ideomotor theory of imitation has come from studies that show imitative responses to be faster than the same behavioural measures performed in response to spatial cues. In an attempt to replicate these findings, we manipulated the salience of the visual cue and found that we could reverse the advantage of the imitative cue over the spatial cue. We suggest that participants utilised a simple visuomotor mechanism to perform all aspects of this task, with performance being driven by the relative visual salience of the stimuli.

Experiment 2 removed pre-cue information and found that preparing a movement of increased distance lengthens RT. Experiment 3 explored movements to targets of cued size at non-cued distances and found size altered peak speed and movement duration but RT was influenced by distance alone. Thus, amplitude influences preparation time (for reasons other than altered duration) but not initiation time.

        "abstract": "What determines coordination patterns when both hands reach to grasp separate objects at the same time? It is known that synchronous timing is preferred as the most stable mode of bimanual coordination. Nonetheless, normal unimanual prehension behaviour predicts asynchrony when the two hands reach towards unequal targets, with synchrony restricted to targets equal in size and distance. Additionally, suYciently separated targets require sequential looking. Does synchrony occur in all cases because it is preferred in bimanual coordination or does asynchrony occur because of unimanual task constraints and the need for sequential looking? We investigated coordinative timing when participants (n= 8) moved their right (preferred) hand to the same object at a fixed distance but the left hand to objects of different width (3, 5, and 7 cm) and grip surface size (1, 2, and 3 cm) placed at different distances (20, 30, and 40 cm) over 270 randomised trials. The hand movements consisted of two components:(1) an initial component (IC) during which the hand reached towards the target while forming an appropriate grip aperture, stopping at (but not touching) the object;(2) a completion component (CC) during which the finger and thumb closed on the target. The two limbs started the IC together but did not interact until the deceleration phase when evidence of synchronisation began to appear. Nonetheless, asynchronous timing was present at the end of the IC and preserved through the CC even with equidistant targets. Thus, there was synchrony but requirements for visual information ultimately yielded asynchronous coordinative timing.",

Participants completed four tasks during which feedback was given according to group allocation as well as two skills transfer tests. Skill retention was examined immediately after training, at 1 week and at 1 month post‐test. Results Statistically significant differences were found …",

Its main role is to enable high precision track and vertex reconstruction, with data-driven readout to the software trigger at 40 MHz, in the higher-luminosity environment of Run 3. To achieve this goal, significant improvements are planned with respect to the current detector, including a switch from microstrips to pixels, upgraded electronics, and a new cooling system.

        "abstract": "IntroductionOlder adults show increased postural sway and a greater risk of falls when completing activities with high cognitive demands. While dual-task approaches have clarified an association between cognitive processes and postural control, it is unclear how manual ability, which is also required for the successful completion of cognitively demanding tasks (such as putting a key into a lock), affects this relationship.MethodKinematic technology was used to explore the relationship between postural sway and manual control in healthy younger and older adults. Participants (n = 82) remained standing to complete a visual-motor tracking task on a tablet computer. Root mean square tracking error measured manual performance, and a balance board measured deviations in centre of pressure as a marker of postural sway.ResultsOlder adults displayed poorer manual accuracy and increased postural sway across …",

The analysis is based on pp collision data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3 fb− 1 collected by the LHCb experiment in 2011 and 2012. The long-distance contribution to the B+→ K+ μ+ μ− decay is modelled as a sum of relativistic Breit–Wigner amplitudes representing different vector meson resonances decaying to muon pairs, each with their own magnitude and phase. The measured phases of the J/ψ and ψ (2S) resonances are such that the interference with the short-distance component in dimuon mass regions far from their pole masses is small. In addition, constraints are placed on the Wilson coefficients, C9 and C10, and the branching fraction of the short-distance component is measured.",

The same researcher might wish to collect such data with hundreds of participants outside the laboratory, and the use of a VR headset makes this a realistic proposition. The difficulty facing the researcher is that sophisticated 3-D graphics engines (e.g., Unity) have been created for game designers rather than behavioral scientists.

        "abstract": "Background Fundamental Movement Skills (FMS) play a critical role in ontogenesis. Many children have insufficient FMS, highlighting the need for universal screening in schools. There are many observational FMS assessment tools, but their psychometric properties are not readily accessible. A systematic review was therefore undertaken to compile evidence of the validity and reliability of observational FMS assessments, to evaluate their suitability for screening.   Methods A pre-search of ‘fundamental movement skills’ OR ‘fundamental motor skills’ in seven online databases (PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, EBSCO CINAHL, EBSCO SPORTDiscus, Ovid PsycINFO and Web of Science) identified 24 assessment tools for school-aged children that: (i) assess FMS; (ii) measure actual motor competence and (iii) evaluate performance on a standard battery of tasks. Studies were subsequently identified that: (a) used these tools; (b) quantified validity or reliability and (c) sampled school-aged children. Study quality was assessed using COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement INstruments (COSMIN) checklists.   Results Ninety studies were included following the screening of 1863 articles. Twenty-one assessment tools had limited or no evidence to support their psychometric properties. The Test of Gross Motor Development (TGMD, n = 34) and the Movement Assessment Battery for Children (MABC, n = 37) were the most researched tools. Studies consistently reported good evidence for validity, reliability for the TGMD, whilst only 64% of studies reported similarly promising results for the MABC. Twelve studies found …",

We examined whether learning new meanings for familiar words affects the processing of their existing meanings. Adults learnt fictitious meanings for previously unambiguous words over four consecutive days. We tested comprehension of existing meanings using a semantic relatedness decision task in which the probe word was related to the existing but not the new meaning. Following the training, responses were slower to the trained, but not to the untrained, words, indicating competition between newly-acquired and well-established meanings. This effect was smaller for meanings that were semantically related to existing meanings than for the unrelated counterparts, demonstrating that meaning relatedness modulates the degree of competition.

They offer both practical and pedagogical benefits, but there are concerns about the effect that perceptual deficiencies in VR systems (e.g. reduced haptic information, and stereoscopic display distortions) may have on learning and performance. ‘Specificity of learning’ theories suggest that VR could be ineffective (or even detrimental) if important differences (e.g. perceptual deficiencies) exist between practice and real task performance conditions. Nevertheless, ‘structural learning’ theories suggest VR could be a useful training tool, despite these deficiencies, because a trainee can still learn the underlying structure of the behaviour.

The best existing robot planners are based on random sampling of configuration space- which becomes excessively high-dimensional with large number of objects. Consequently, most planners often fail to efficiently find object manipulation plans in such environments. We addressed this problem by identifying high-level manipulation plans in humans, and transferring these skills to robot planners. We used virtual reality to capture human participants reaching for a target object on a tabletop cluttered with obstacles. From this, we devised a qualitative representation of the task space to abstract the decision making, irrespective of the number of obstacles. Based on this representation, human demonstrations were segmented and used to train decision classifiers. Using these classifiers, our planner produced a …",

A limited number of studies have examined iodine status and birth outcomes, finding inconsistent evidence for specific outcomes. Maternal iodine status was estimated from spot urine samples collected at 26–28 weeks’ gestation from 6971 mothers in the Born in Bradford birth cohort. Associations with outcomes were examined for both urinary iodine concentration (UIC) and iodine-to-creatinine ratio (I:Cr). Outcomes assessed included customised birthweight (primary outcome), birthweight, small for gestational age (SGA), low birthweight, head circumference and APGAR score. There was a small positive association between I:Cr and birthweight in adjusted analyses. For a typical participant, the predicted birthweight centile at the 25th percentile of I:Cr (59 μg/g) was 2.7 percentage points lower than that at the 75th percentile of I:Cr (121 μg/g) (99% confidence interval (CI) 0.8 to 4.6), birthweight was predicted to be 41 g lower (99% CI 13 to 69) and the predicted probability of SGA was 1.9 percentage points higher (99% CI 0.0 to 3.7). There was no evidence of associations using UIC or other birth outcomes, including stillbirth, preterm birth, ultrasound growth measures or congenital anomalies.

Virtual reality (VR) haptic simulators, systems able to provide objective measures of sensorimotor performance, are beginning to establish their utility in facilitating sensorimotor skill acquisition, and it is possible that they may also inform the prediction of clinical performance.Methods A retrospective cohort study examined the relationship between student performance on a haptic VR simulator in the second year of undergraduate dental study with subsequent clinic performance involving patients 2 years later.

Pharmacological interventions constitute the first-line treatment for TN, with antiepileptic drugs commonly prescribed. People treated for TN pain with antiepileptic drugs describe cognitive and motor difficulties affecting activities of daily living, and report poorer quality of life. We undertook the first comprehensive objective evaluation of sensorimotor and cognitive performance in participants being treated for TN pain with antiepileptic drugs relative to age-matched controls. Participants (43 TN, 41 control) completed a battery of sensorimotor (steering, aiming and tracking) and cognitive (working memory, processing speed, inhibition) tasks. The TN group performed significantly worse than controls on the sensorimotor tracking and aiming tasks and across all cognitive measures. The data explain why patients treated with antiepileptic drugs report impairment when conducting activities of daily living (given the need for cognitive and motor capability within most of these). The study is an important first step in: (i) ensuring there is adequate information on the impact of pharmacological treatment; (ii) identifying measures to determine optimal medication dosage and track change over time; (iii) creating an evidence base that could allow scientific justification of alternative pain treatment options for TN (e.g. the costs/benefits of surgery).",

Fifty-four patients (27 with dyslexia, 27 controls) underwent extensive optometric testing. Measurements included visual acuity, cycloplegic refraction, accommodation, and binocular vision testing. There was a higher proportion of individuals with dyslexia presenting with optometric problems compared to controls. For children, the most common diagnoses were hypermetropia and accommodation insufficiency. The results strongly suggest that an optometric examination should be included in the management of dyslexia.",

        "abstract": "Disturbance forces facilitate motor learning, but theoretical explanations for this counterintuitive phenomenon are lacking. Smooth arm movements require predictions (inference) about the force-field associated with a workspace. The Free Energy Principle (FEP) suggests that such ‘active inference’ is driven by ‘surprise’. We used these insights to create a formal model that explains why disturbance might help learning. In two experiments, participants undertook a continuous tracking task where they learned how to move their arm in different directions through a novel 3D force field. We compared baseline performance before and after exposure to the novel field to quantify learning. In Experiment 1, the exposure phases (but not the baseline measures) were delivered under three different conditions: (i) robot haptic assistance; (ii) no guidance; (iii) robot haptic disturbance. The disturbance group showed the best learning as our model predicted. Experiment 2 further tested our FEP inspired model. Assistive and/or disturbance forces were applied as a function of performance (low surprise), and compared to a random error manipulation (high surprise). The random group showed the most improvement as predicted by the model. Thus, motor learning can be conceptualised as a process of entropy reduction. Short term motor strategies (e.g. global impedance) can mitigate unexpected perturbations, but continuous movements require active inference about external force-fields in order to create accurate internal models of the external world (motor learning). Our findings reconcile research on the relationship between noise, variability, and motor …",

Methods: In this RCT, patients were allocated in a 1: 1: 1: 1 ratio to four groups: systematic mental rehearsal (SMR) using MRI scans; SMR and three-dimensional (3D) virtual models; SMR and synthetic 3D printed models; and routine practice (control group). Surgeons operating on all but the control group underwent mental rehearsal with the visual aids, including axial MRI scans of the pelvis, interactive 3D virtual models reconstructed from axial MRIs, and synthetic models, manufactured by 3D printing. Operations were video-recorded and assessed by two experts blinded to allocation using two validated scores, the Competency Assessment Tool (CAT) and Objective Clinical Human Reliability Analysis (OCHRA). The primary outcome of the study was surgical performance, measured by the CAT.Results: Forty-nine patients were randomized and allocated to the four groups.

Recent evidence suggests “warming up” before operating could improve intra-operative performance with parallels to elite sporting events. We aimed to explore receptiveness, warm-up preferences, and whether strategies to warm up differ as a function of experience.Material & Methods: An electronic survey was distributed via training programs, specialty associations and social media. Questions concerned seniority, operative experience, use of warm-up strategies and perceptions of warm-up. Free text comments were grouped into themes for analysis.Results: There were 284 replies from diverse surgical specialties with 52% of replies from senior surgeons (consultants/attendings). Trainees employed various Methods to warm-up including …"

        "abstract": " Human sensorimotor decision-making has a tendency to get ‘stuck in a rut’, being biased towards selecting a previously implemented action structure (‘hysteresis’). Existing explanations cannot provide a principled account of when hysteresis will occur. We propose that hysteresis is an emergent property of a dynamical system learning from the consequences of its actions. To examine this, 152 participants moved a cursor to a target on a tablet device whilst avoiding an obstacle. Hysteresis was observed when the obstacle moved sequentially across the screen between trials, but not with random obstacle placement. Two further experiments (n = 20) showed an attenuation when time and resource constraints were eased. We created a simple computational model capturing dynamic probabilistic estimate updating that showed the same patterns of results. This provides the first computational demonstration of how sensorimotor decision-making can get ‘stuck in a rut’ through the dynamic updating of its probability estimates.Significance Statement Humans show a bias to select the organisational structure of a recently carried out action, even when an alternative option is available with lower costs. This ‘hysteresis’ is said to be more efficient than creating a new plan and it has been interpreted as a ‘design feature’ within decision-making systems. We suggest such teleological arguments are redundant, with hysteresis being a naturally emergent property of a dynamic control system that evolved to operate effectively in an uncertain and partially observable world. Empirical experimentation and simulations from a ‘first principle’ computational model of …",

We used virtual reality to generate data from human participants whilst they reached for objects on a cluttered table top. From this, we devised a qualitative representation of the task space to abstract human decisions, irrespective of the number of objects in the way. Based on this representation, human demonstrations were segmented and used to train decision classifiers. Using these classifiers, our planner produced a list of waypoints in the task space. These waypoints provide a high-level plan, which can be transferred to any arbitrary robot model. The VR dataset is released here."

Following exposure, participants completed a Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ) to assess for nausea, disorientation, and oculomotor disturbances. A user evaluation study of this software was conducted to explore the potential utility of this application.Results: Fifty-seven subjects completed the user testing (34 males and 23 females). Mean age was 48.5 years (range, 21–77 years). Mean acquired work experience of the 35 ophthalmologists (61.40%) included in the group was 15.46 years (range, 1–37 years). Twenty-nine participants were VR-naïve. The SSQ showed a mean total score of 5.8 (SD= 9.44) indicating that the system was well tolerated and produced minimal side effects. No difference was reported between VR-naïve participants and experienced users. Overall, immersed subjects reported an enjoyable VR-OCT presence effect.Conclusions: A usable and satisfying VR imaging technique was developed to display and interact with original OCT data.Translational Relevance: An advanced high-end VR image display method was successfully developed to provide new views and interactions in an ultra high-speed projected digital scenery using point-cloud OCT data.

Consolidation will occur, and modest enhancements of the Upgrade I detector will be installed, in Long Shutdown 3 of the LHC (2025) and these are discussed here. The main Upgrade II detector will be installed in long shutdown 4 of the LHC (2030) and will build on the strengths of the current LHCb experiment and the Upgrade I. It will operate at a luminosity up to , ten times that of the Upgrade I detector. New detector components will improve the intrinsic performance of the experiment in certain key areas.

Piaget suggested that children need to learn the physical rules that govern their environment before they can represent abstract concepts such as number and time. Thus, learning how objects move in space and time may underpin the development of related abstract representations (i.e., mathematics). To test this hypothesis, we captured objective measures of interceptive timing in 309 primary school children (5–11 years old), alongside scores for general motor skill and national standardized academic attainment. Bayesian estimation showed that interceptive timing (but not general motor capability) uniquely predicted mathematical ability even after we controlled for age, reading, and writing attainment.

For spatially constrained aiming, the trade-off is often said to take the specific form of Fitts’ law, in which movement duration is predicted from a single factor combining target distance and target size. However, efforts to extend this law to the three-dimensional context of reaching to grasp (prehension) have had limited success. We suggest that there are potentially confounding influences in standard grasping, and we introduce a novel task to regularize the direction of approach and to eliminate the influences of nearby surfaces. In six participants, we examined speed–accuracy trade-offs for prehension, manipulating the depth (in the plane of the reach), height (orthogonal to the reach), and width (the grasped dimension) of the target object independently. We obtained lawful relationships that were consistent at the group and individual levels. It took …",

But what is the influence of asymmetric contact surfaces? In Experiment 1a, participants reached-to-lift wooden blocks off a table top, with the contact locations for the thumb and index finger varying in surface size. The time taken to lift the block was driven primarily by the thumb contact surface, which showed a larger effect size for the dependent variable of movement duration than the index finger’s contact surface. In Experiment 1b participants reached-to-grasp (but not lift) the blocks. The same effect was found with duration being largely driven by contact surface size for the thumb. Experiment 2 tested whether this finding generalised to movements towards conical frusta grasped in a different plane mounted off the table top. Experiment 2 showed that movement duration again was dictated primarily by the size of the thumb’s contact surface. The thumb contact surface was the visible surface in experiments 1 and 2 so Experiment 3 explored grasping when the index finger’s contact surface was visible (participants grasped the frusta with the index finger at the top). An interaction between thumb and finger surface size was now found to determine movement duration. These findings provide the first empirical report of the impact of asymmetric contact surfaces on prehension, and may have implications for scientists who wish to model reach-to-grasp behaviours.",

The images of all nodules, acquired from 10 different types of ultrasound equipment, were dynamically stored in the form of the consecutively longitudinal and transverse sections. Then the AI-assisted …",

This is particularly evident with sample exchange; where fast, reliable, and accurate handling is required to ensure high quality and high throughput data collection. This paper looks at the design, build, and integration of an in-house robot control system. The system was designed to improve reliability and exchange times, provide high sample storage capacity, and accommodate easy upgrade paths, whilst gaining and maintaining inhouse robotics knowledge. The paper also highlights how peripheral components were brought under the control of a Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) based integration unit, including a vision system.",

The sample consists of about 1000 Ω b−→ Ω c 0 μ− ν μ X signal decays, where the Ω c 0 baryon is detected in the p K− K− π+ final state and X represents possible additional undetected particles in the decay. The Ω c 0 lifetime is measured to be τ Ω c 0= 268±24±10±2 fs, where the uncertainties are statistical, systematic, and from the uncertainty in the D+ lifetime, respectively. This value is nearly four times larger than, and inconsistent with, the current world-average value."

We use machine learning to boost productivity by training regressors on traditionally tracked performances and applying those models to the remaining performances. Our specialized regressor for HMC marker-based tracking shows improvements in quality and robustness for marker tracks. The regressor results are automatically refined by a simple blob detection tool and then imported back into the tracking tool such that manual correction can be applied as needed and subsequently included as additional training data. This iterative approach reduces 70% the amount of artist time required for traditional tracking methods and does not add much setup time nor planning as alternative techniques."

A satisfactory description of the data is obtained when including a contribution representing an exotic ηc(1S)π− resonant state. The significance of this exotic resonance is more than three standard deviations, while its mass and width are 4096 ± 20 +18 −22 MeV and 152±58 +60 −35 MeV, respectively. The spin-parity assignments J P = 0+ and J P = 1− are both consistent with the data. In addition, the first measurement of the B0 → ηc(1S)K+π− branching fraction is performed and gives B(B⁰→ ηc(1S)K+π-) = (5.73 ± 0.24 ± 0.13 ± 0.66) × 10−4, where the first uncertainty is statistical, the second systematic, and the third is due to limited knowledge of external branching fractions. ©2018 Author(s)",

        "abstract": "A measurement of the time-integrated CP asymmetry in D⁰ → KS⁰ KS⁰ decays is reported. The data correspond to an integrated luminosity of about 2 fb⁻¹ collected in 2015–2016 by the LHCb collaboration in pp collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. The D0 candidate is required to originate from a D*⁺ → D⁰π⁺ decay, allowing the determination of the flavour of the D0 meson using the pion charge. The D⁰ → K⁺K⁻ decay, which has a well measured CP asymmetry, is used as a calibration channel. The CP asymmetryfor D⁰ → KS⁰ KS⁰ is measured to be ACP D⁰ → KS⁰ KS⁰ = 4.3 ± 3.4 ± 1.0) %, where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second is systematic. This result is combined with the previous LHCb measurement at lower centre-of-mass energies to obtain ACP D⁰ → KS⁰ KS⁰ = (2.3 ± 2.8 ± 0.9) %.

Studies in the United States have found lower rates of autism diagnosis associated with lower socioeconomic status, while studies in other countries report no association, or the opposite. This article aims to contribute to the understanding of this relationship in the United Kingdom. Using data from the Born in Bradford cohort, comprising 13,857 children born between 2007 and 2011, it was found that children of mothers educated to A-level or above had twice the rate of autism diagnosis, 1.5% of children (95% confidence interval: 1.1%, 1.9%) compared to children of mothers with lower levels of education status 0.7% (95% confidence interval: 0.5%, 0.9%).

        "abstract": "Some activities can be meaningfully dichotomised as ‘cognitive’ or ‘sensorimotor’ in nature—but many cannot. This has radical implications for understanding activity limitation in disability. For example, older adults take longer to learn the serial order of a complex sequence but also exhibit slower, more variable and inaccurate motor performance. So is their impaired skill acquisition a cognitive or motor deficit? We modelled sequence learning as a process involving a limited capacity buffer (working memory), where reduced performance restricts the number of elements that can be stored. To test this model, we examined the relationship between motor performance and sequence learning. Experiment 1 established that older adults were worse at learning the serial order of a complex sequence. Experiment 2 found that participants showed impaired sequence learning when the non-preferred hand was used. Experiment 3 confirmed that serial order learning is impaired when motor demands increase (as the model predicted). These results can be captured by reinforcement learning frameworks which suggest sequence learning will be constrained both by an individual’s sensorimotor ability and cognitive capacity.",

In order to achieve these physics goals, the trajectories of stable charged particles (tracks) need to be reconstructed accurately and with a high and well-known efficiency. The precise knowledge of this charged-particle reconstruction efficiency is essential in measurements of branching fractions, for example. While muons produced in heavy flavour decays are nearly unhindered by the LHCb detector material, electrons suffer from energy loss via bremsstrahlung. In some cases, the energy loss affects the trajectory to such a degree that the electrons no longer traverse all tracking detectors. Therefore, the track-reconstruction efficiency for electrons describes not only the performance of the trackreconstruction algorithms for electrons, but also the impact of this loss in geometrical …",

For a VR simulation to elicit effective transfer of training to the real-world, it must provide a sufficient level of validity, that is, it must be representative of the real-world skill. In order to develop the most effective simulations, assessments of validity should be carried out prior to implementing simulations in training.Objective: The aim of this work was to test elements of the physical fidelity, psychological fidelity and construct validity of a VR golf putting simulation. Method: Self-report measures of task load and presence in the simulation were taken following real and simulated golf putting to assess psychological and physical fidelity. The performance of novice and expert golfers in the simulation was also compared as an initial test of construct validity.Results: Participants reported a high degree of presence in the simulation and there was little difference between real and virtual putting in terms of task demands. Experts performed significantly better in the simulation than novices (p=. 001, d= 1.23) and there was a significant relationship between performance on the real and virtual tasks (r=. 46, p=. 004). Conclusions: The results indicated that the simulation exhibited an acceptable degree of construct validity and psychological fidelity. However, some differences between the real and virtual tasks emerged, suggesting further validation work is required.",

        "abstract": "Virtual reality (VR) systems hold significant potential for both training and experimentation 1 purposes as they provide precise control over the environment and the possibility to untether 2 tasks from their normal physical constraints. However, the artificial creation of depth in 3 stereoscopic displays, and reduced availability of haptic information, may affect how 4 visually-guided motor tasks are performed in the virtual world. If so, tasks learned in VR may 5 be unrepresentative of real skills, and therefore unlikely to elicit positive transfer to the real-6 world. In Experiment 1 we tested whether learning a visually-guided motor skill (golf 7 putting) in virtual reality could transfer to real-world improvements. Despite the perceptual 8 limitations imposed by the virtual environment, training novice golfers in VR led to 9 improvements in real putting that were comparable to real-world practice. Experiment 2 10 explored these effects in more skilled golfers, and examined changes in gaze behaviour (quiet 11 eye) that resulted from the more immediate use of VR (ie as a tool for ‘warming up’). VR 12 use was found to cause impairments to gaze control (quiet eye) and putting accuracy, when 13 used immediately prior to real world putting. Overall, these findings demonstrate the 14 potential for VR training, but also highlight that fundamental questions remain about how the 15 altered perceptual environment of VR affects visually-guided skills. 16",

To explore how the brain responds to these different types of errors, we examined EEG signatures of feedback-related processing while participants performed a simple decision-making task. In Experiment 1, we used a task in which unrewarded outcomes were framed as selection errors, similar to how feedback information is treated in most studies. Consistent with previous work, EEG differences between rewarded and unrewarded trials in the medial frontal negativity (MFN) correlated with behavioral adjustment. In Experiment 2, the task was modified such that unrewarded outcomes could arise from either poor execution or selection. For selection errors, the results replicated that observed in Experiment 1. However, unrewarded outcomes attributed to poor execution produced larger amplitude MFN, alongside an attenuation in activity preceding this component and a subsequent enhanced error positivity (Pe) response in posterior sites. In terms of behavioral correlates, only the degree of the early attenuation and amplitude of the Pe correlated with behavioral adjustment following execution errors relative to reward; the amplitude of the MFN did not correlate with behavioral changes related to execution errors. These results indicate the existence of distinct neural correlates of selection and execution error processing and are consistent with the hypothesis that execution errors can modulate action selection evaluation. More generally, they provide insight into how the brain responds to different classes of error that determine future action …",

Nevertheless, it prevents the surgeon from directly touching and manipulating tissue and therefore severely restricts the use of valuable techniques such as palpation. Accordingly a key challenge in MIS is to restore haptic feedback to the surgeon. This paper reviews the state‐of‐the‐art in laparoscopic palpation devices (LPDs) with particular focus on device mechanisms, sensors and data analysis. It concludes by examining the challenges that must be overcome to create effective LPD systems that measure and display haptic information to the surgeon for improved intraoperative assessment.

We therefore tested the predictions of behavioural change from reduced hemispheric function by measuring tracing performance (arguably one of the most lateralised of human behaviours) along paths of different thickness in a group of healthy young and older adults.

We observed two distinct movement patterns across all trials—participants either: (i) brought their arm to a stop, secured the object and lifted it from the tabletop; or (ii) grasped the object ‘on-the-fly’, so it was secured in the hand while the arm was moving. A majority of grasps were on-the-fly when the texture was high-friction and none when the object was low-friction, with medium-friction producing an intermediate proportion. Previous research has shown that the probability of on-the-fly behaviour is a function of grasp surface accuracy constraints. A finger friction rig was used to calculate the coefficients of friction for the objects and these calculations showed that the area available for a stable grasp (the ‘functional grasp surface size’) increased with surface friction coefficient. Thus, knowledge of functional grasp surface size is required to predict the probability of observing a given qualitative form of grasping in human prehensile behaviour.",

Visual capture can produce powerful illusory effects with individuals misjudging the size and position of their hands. The advent of laparoscopic surgical techniques raises the question of whether visual capture can interfere with an individual's rate of motor learning. We compared adaptation to distorted visual feedback in two groups: the Direct group appeared to have the advantage of directly viewing the input device, while the Indirect group used the same input device but viewed their movements on a remote screen. Counterintuitively, the Indirect group adapted more readily to distorted feedback and showed enhanced performance. The results show that visual capture impairs adaptation to distorted visual feedback, suggesting that surgeons need to avoid viewing their hands when learning …",

In contrast, allowing the surgeon to move without constraints could improve performance because this provides greater experience of the control dynamics of the device. In order to test between these alternatives, we created an experimental tool that connected a commercially available robotic arm with specialised software that presents visual stimuli and objectively records kinematics. Participants were given the task of generating a series of aiming movements to move a visual cursor to a series of targets. The actions required movement along a horizontal plane, whereas the …"

Biochemical pharmacology remains a major tool in drug discovery, being employed in the search for novel therapeutics for the above and other conditions and clinical challenges, such as neurodegenerative disorders, for the treatment of pain, and for development of agents that do not induce, or can overcome, antibiotic/antiviral resistance. Together with chemical, molecular, genetic, physiological, and clinical sciences, biochemical pharmacology will in the coming decades continue to be a …"

An alternative explanation, however, is that hand differences are subtle, and capturing them requires tasks that yield optimal performance with both hands. Whereas the hemispheric specialisation account implies that reduced manual asymmetries should be reliably observed in older adults, the ‘measurement difficulty’ account suggests that manual asymmetries will be hard to detect unless a task has just the right level of difficulty—i.e. within the ‘Goldilocks Zone’, where it is not too easy or too hard, but just right. Experiment One tested this hypothesis and found that manual asymmetries were only detected when participants performed in this zone; specifically, performance on a tracing task was only superior in the preferred hand when task constraints were high (i.e. fast speed tracing). Experiment Two used three different tasks to examine age differences in manual asymmetries; one task produced no asymmetries, whilst two tasks revealed asymmetries in both younger and older groups (with poorer overall performance in the old group across all tasks). Experiment Three revealed task-dependent asymmetries in both age groups, but highlighted further detection difficulties linked with the metric of performance and compensatory strategies used by participants. Results are discussed with reference to structural learning theory, whereby we suggest that the processes of inter-manual transfer lead to relatively small performance differences between the hands (despite a …",

Children made less saccade errors compared to young adults, but they also exhibited longer response times in cued versus non-cued conditions. In contrast, older adults showed faster responses in cued conditions but exhibited more errors. The results indicate that young adults (18–25 years) achieve an optimal balance between anticipation and execution. In contrast, children show benefits (few errors) and costs (slow responses) of good inhibition when preparing a motor response based on advance information; whilst older adults show the benefits and costs associated with a prospective response strategy (i.e., good anticipation).",

The increasing prevalence of virtual reality devices raises the question of whether we can exploit these systems to accelerate the training of compliance discrimination in trainee surgeons. We used a haptic feedback device and stylus to assess the abilities of naïve participants to detect compliance differences with and without knowledge of results (KR) (groups 1 and 2), as well as the abilities of participants who had undergone repetitive training over several days (group 3). Kinematic analyses were carried out to objectively measure the probing action. Untrained participants had poor detection thresholds (mean just noticeable difference, JND = 33%), and we found no effect of KR (provided after each trial) on performance (mean JND = 35%).

With the arrival of fast, pixel array detectors on all the MX beamlines at Diamond, the data collection times have reduced considerably and the number of samples being studied per eight hour shift has more than doubled in the past five years (Fig. 1). Consequently there has been a drive to increase the capacity and efficiency of the sample changers.Since January, a new robotic sample changer has been operational on beamline I03. The new robot, BART (Fig. 2), has improved exchange times, increased sample capacity significantly and is more tightly integrated into the beamline control systems which means reliability has also improved."

The underlying event in pp processes falls into the second category. Therefore soft QCD interactions need careful study to enable tuning of the models at a new centre-of-mass energy. Strangeness production is an important ingredient of this effort. Measurements of φ production have been reported by various experiments [1–7] in different collision types, for different centreof-mass energies and different kinematic coverage. LHCb is fully instrumented in the forward region and thus yields unique results complementary to previous experiments and to the other LHC experiments.",

It provides precise predictions for measurable quantities that can be tested experimentally. The probabilities, or branching fractions, of the strangeB meson (B0 s ) andtheB0meson decaying into two oppositely charged muons (μ+ and μ-) are especially interesting because of their sensitivity to theories that extend the standard model. The standard model predicts that the B0 s→μ+μ- and B0 s→μ+μ- decays are very rare, with about four of the former occurring for every billion B0 s mesons produced, and one of the latter occurring for every ten billion B0 mesons1. A difference in the observed branching fractions with respect to the predictions of the standard model would provide a direction in which the standard model should be extended. Before the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN2 started operating, no evidence for either decay mode had been found. Upper limits on the branching fractions were an order of magnitude above the standard model predictions. The CMS (CompactMuonSolenoid) andLHCb(LargeHadronCollider beauty) collaborations have performed a joint analysis of the data from proton'proton collisions that they collected in 2011 at a centre-ofmass energy of seven teraelectronvolts and in 2012 at eight teraelectronvolts.

A fundamental issue in cognitive neuroscience is how movements vary in response to task requirements. It is important to address:(i) what lawful relations exist between task constraints and behaviour;(ii) which relations are stable across tasks;(iii) does behaviour change lawfully with task alteration? We asked participants to reach-and-grasp objects under different experimental conditions (n= 6 per condition). The participant's preferred hand moved to objects of different grip surface size (1, 2, 3cm) and object width (3, 5 and 7cm) placed at different distances (20, 30, 40cm). In condition 1, participants were allowed to touch the table off which the target objects were to be lifted. Movements showed the ‘classic’prehension pattern and object distance was the only variable that predicted duration. In condition 2, participants …"

These abilities are highly dependent upon the ability to understand others' intentions and desires by ‘reading’facial expressions and eye gaze direction. Instruments developed to diagnose ASD find that the ability to follow the direction of other's eye gaze, is impaired in ASD and discriminates between these children and those with other disorders. However, experiments have found that children with ASD reduce their reaction times to a two-choice stimulus, by taking advantage of a precue in the form of an eye gaze stimulus. These studies may be problematic as they employed static images of eyes that were removed from the face, and which could be treated as symbolic stimuli. In this study, 10 children with ASD and an age-matched control group were presented with a realistic …"

We studied the development of this ability in four groups of children (n= 10 for each group) aged between 5 and 12 years using a facial pre-cue paradigm.

It therefore appears that facial expression may influence behaviour to a greater extent under the effects of alcohol. We were interested in whether ethyl alcohol altered the ability to derive intentional cues from facial observation, or inhibit responses to those cues. To explore this issue, we used a simple two choice reaction time task in 8 healthy, right handed non-smoking males of BMI= 18–21 in a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover design.

This raises the question of how sensitive is DF to looming information that ordinarily signals object approach and time to collision (TTC)? We first established that DF has a reasonable ability to catch a ball that is thrown to her in a straightforward fashion. We next presented DF with a range of looming and changing size stimuli.

The technique used will be to imbed each spin-j system, with (2 j+ 1) independent elements, into the higher dimension space of rank-j tensors, with 4 j independent elements. Supplementary conditions, known as the Rarita-Schwinger conditions [1], will then be needed to reduce the number of independent elements to the proper number. The reason for using this imbedding process, is that the transformation properties of the spin-j system become those of the rank-j tensor. Thus, coupling the spin-j system to any 4-momenta or other spin tensors (including half-integer spin tensors discussed in section (3)) to form a Lorentz scalar becomes a staight forward process."

To better understand the state-of-art, dental educators from across Europe were invited to a workshop in Leeds, England to reflect on how they use simulation for teaching, the benefits and challenges it brings, and in light of the increasing prevalence of virtual reality-based simulators, explore how dental education can most benefit from emerging technologies in the coming years. Over a period of 2.5 years, notes from the workshop discussions were shared globally with the wider educational community. Contributors included dentists, dental educators, educational researchers, healthcare specialists from disciplines with related challenges (surgeons performing minimally invasive procedures), psychologists studying the processes underlying human learning, engineers pioneering the development of surgical technologies, and computer scientists working at the cutting edge of virtual reality and artificial intelligence. Contentious issues were debated and documented and in sum, individuals representing 31 institutions across the globe contributed to work that has culminated in the present report-the first International Consensus report on the state-of-art in dental simulation research and pedagogical practice. We detail when and where simulation could be utilized with reference to the current evidence base and outline outstanding questions.

The manner in which the nervous system combines these various cues is of considerable interest. Although it is accepted that image cues play a signi¢ cant role in distance perception, controversy exists regarding the use of kinaesthetic information about the eyes' state of convergence. We used a perturbation technique to explore the contribution of vergence to visually based distance estimates as a function of both¢ xation distance and the availability of retinal information. Our results show that the nervous system increases the weighting given to vergence as (i)¢ xation distance becomes closer; and (ii) the available retinal image cues decrease. We also identi¢ ed the presence of a strong contraction bias when distance cues were studied in isolation, but we argue that such biases do not suggest that vergence provides an ine¡ ectual signal for near-space perception.",

        "abstract": "Economic, physical, built, cultural, learning, social and service environments have a profound effect on lifelong health. However, policy thinking about health research is dominated by the ‘biomedical model’which promotes medicalisation and an emphasis on diagnosis and treatment at the expense of prevention. Prevention research has tended to focus on ‘downstream’interventions that rely on individual behaviour change, frequently increasing inequalities. Preventive strategies often focus on isolated leverage points and are scattered across different settings. This paper describes a major new prevention research programme that aims to create City Collaboratory testbeds to support the identification, implementation and evaluation of upstream interventions within a whole system city setting. Prevention of physical and mental ill-health will come from the cumulative effect of multiple system-wide interventions. Rather than scatter these interventions across many settings and evaluate single outcomes, we will test their collective impact across multiple outcomes with the goal of achieving a tipping point for better health. Our focus is on early life (ActEarly) in recognition of childhood and adolescence being such critical periods for influencing lifelong health and wellbeing.",

During Run 1 of LHC operations (2010-2012) it accumulated 3 fb− 1 of proton-proton collision data, giving the world’s largest sample of bottom and charm hadron data. This has enabled the development of a fruitful and exciting physics program, with over 250 papers already published [1], and more than 20 analysis talks at this conference. LHC Run 2 (2015-2018) has recently started, and should provide a further 5 fb− 1 of integrated luminosity for analysis. The LHCb detector is a single-arm forward spectrometer, covering the pseudorapidity region 2< η< 5 [2]. Closest to the interaction point is the Vertex Locator (VELO), a silicon microstrip detector providing high precision track and vertex reconstruction. Downstream of the VELO are additional tracking stations either on side of a 4 Tm dipole magnet. Particle identification is provided by two RICH detectors, followed by electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters, and a multilayer muon system.During 2019–2020 the LHCb detector will undergo a major upgrade, with the principal objective of increasing the collected yields of signal samples to be analysed in Run 3 and beyond (2021–), which will lead to order-of-magnitude increases in the precision of key parameters.

Neurological and psychiatric disorders have a marked deleterious effect on quality of life, including the ability to work, maintain normal social interactions, and live independently, and can have a significantly negative impact on lifespan. While CNS disorders are highly debilitating on an individual basis, they also exact a significant toll on family members and on society as a whole. CNS disorders have been estimated to account for up to 15% of work days lost to disease, and approximately 20% of the nationwide cost of healthcare in the USA. Since age is a major risk factor for many CNS disorders, it is anticipated that these numbers will rise significantly as the population ages. Based on the size of the affected population and the impact on quality of life, this area as a whole continues to represent a major unmet medical need.",

        "abstract": "Economic, physical, built, cultural, learning, social and service environments have a profound effect on lifelong health. However, policy thinking about health research is dominated by the ‘biomedical model’which promotes medicalisation and an emphasis on diagnosis and treatment at the expense of prevention. Prevention research has tended to focus on ‘downstream’interventions that rely on individual behaviour change, frequently increasing inequalities. Preventive strategies often focus on isolated leverage points and are scattered across different settings. This paper describes a major new prevention research programme that aims to create City Collaboratory testbeds to support the identification, implementation and evaluation of upstream interventions within a whole system city setting. Prevention of physical and mental ill-health will come from the cumulative effect of multiple system-wide interventions. Rather than scatter these interventions across many settings and evaluate single outcomes, we will test their collective impact across multiple outcomes with the goal of achieving a tipping point for better health. Our focus is on early life (ActEarly) in recognition of childhood and adolescence being such critical periods for influencing lifelong health and wellbeing.",

But what factors drive such improvements and how should a warm-up be implemented?Methods: In order to address these issues, we adopted a two-pronged approach:(i) we conducted a systematic review of the literature to identify existing studies utilizing preoperative simulation techniques; and (ii) performed task analysis to identify the constituent parts of effective warm-ups. We identified five randomised control trials, four randomised crossover trials and four case series. The majority of these studies reviewed surgical performance following preoperative simulation relative to performance without simulation.Results: Four studies reported outcome measures in real patients and the remainder reported simulated outcome measures. All but one of the studies found that preoperative simulation improves operative outcomes-but this improvement was not found across all measured parameters. Whilst the reviewed studies had a number of methodological issues, the global data indicate that preoperative simulation has substantial potential to improve surgical performance. Analysis of the task characteristics of successful interventions indicated that the majority of these studies employed warm-ups that focused on the visual motor elements of surgery. However, there was no theoretical or empirical basis to inform the design of the intervention in any of these studies. Conclusions: For the potential value of preoperative simulation to be understood and realised, there is an urgent need for a more rigorous approach to the development …",

Addressing this question of construct validity is a fundamental step that is necessary before these systems can be fully integrated into a dental school’s curriculum. In this study, we examined the sensitivity of the Simodont (a haptic virtual reality dental simulator) to differences in dental training experience. Two hundred and eighty-nine participants, with 1 (n= 92), 3 (n= 79), 4 (n= 57) and 5 (n= 61) years of dental training, performed a series of tasks upon their first exposure to the simulator. We found statistically significant differences between novice (Year 1) and experienced dental trainees (operationalised as 3 or more years of training), but no differences between performance of experienced trainees with varying levels of experience. This work represents a crucial first-step in understanding the value of haptic virtual reality simulators in dental education."

        "abstract": " Human sensorimotor decision-making has a tendency to get ‘stuck in a rut’, being biased towards selecting a previously implemented action structure (‘hysteresis’). Existing explanations cannot provide a principled account of when hysteresis will occur. We propose that hysteresis is an emergent property of a dynamical system learning from the consequences of its actions. To examine this, 152 participants moved a cursor to a target on a tablet device whilst avoiding an obstacle. Hysteresis was observed when the obstacle moved sequentially across the screen between trials, but not with random obstacle placement. Two further experiments (n = 20) showed an attenuation when time and resource constraints were eased. We created a simple computational model capturing dynamic probabilistic estimate updating that showed the same patterns of results. This provides the first computational demonstration of how sensorimotor decision-making can get ‘stuck in a rut’ through the dynamic updating of its probability estimates.Significance Statement Humans show a bias to select the organisational structure of a recently carried out action, even when an alternative option is available with lower costs. This ‘hysteresis’ is said to be more efficient than creating a new plan and it has been interpreted as a ‘design feature’ within decision-making systems. We suggest such teleological arguments are redundant, with hysteresis being a naturally emergent property of a dynamic control system that evolved to operate effectively in an uncertain and partially observable world.

        "abstract": "Some activities can be meaningfully dichotomised as ‘cognitive’ or ‘sensorimotor’ in nature—but many cannot. This has radical implications for understanding activity limitation in disability. For example, older adults take longer to learn the serial order of a complex sequence but also exhibit slower, more variable and inaccurate motor performance. So is their impaired skill acquisition a cognitive or motor deficit? We modelled sequence learning as a process involving a limited capacity buffer (working memory), where reduced performance restricts the number of elements that can be stored. To test this model, we examined the relationship between motor performance and sequence learning. Experiment 1 established that older adults were worse at learning the serial order of a complex sequence. Experiment 2 found that participants showed impaired sequence learning when the non-preferred hand was used. Experiment 3 confirmed that serial order learning is impaired when motor demands increase (as the model predicted). These results can be captured by reinforcement learning frameworks which suggest sequence learning will be constrained both by an individual’s sensorimotor ability and cognitive capacity.",

The ability to create three-dimensional visual scenes and to measure responses to the visual stimuli enables the behavioral researcher to test hypotheses in a manner and scale that were previously unfeasible. For example, a researcher wanting to understand interceptive timing behavior might wish to violate Newtonian mechanics so that objects can move in novel 3-D trajectories. The same researcher might wish to collect such data with hundreds of participants outside the laboratory, and the use of a VR headset makes this a realistic proposition. The difficulty facing the researcher is that sophisticated 3-D graphics engines (e.g., Unity) have been created for game designers rather than behavioral scientists.

        "abstract": "There is a long tradition of studying economic decision making, where humans often fail to maximise expected gain. More recently, attention has been directed towards decision making in mathematically equivalent sensorimotor tasks, where humans often approach maximum expected gain. But numerous everyday tasks have ‘cognitive’ and ‘sensorimotor’ costs. This raises a fundamental, but hitherto neglected research question about the factors that influence decision making when an economic choice has sensorimotor risks. We created a ‘game’ in virtual reality where participants needed to hit targets in order to win points. The game required participants to choose between two targets where one was easier to hit (closer and on permanent display) and the alternative was a harder-to-hit ‘risky’ target worth more points (further away and programmed to time-out). The time allowed to hit the ‘risky’ target was the median of the individual’s baseline trials. Participants deceased their movement time during the baseline trials so the risky targets were more likely to be hit than not regardless of their distance (this resulted in the risky targets having a higher expected gain with respect to the extrinsic reward). In Experiment 1, we found participants (n = 40) were motivated by the reward (so frequently selected the higher value target). Nevertheless, the behaviour was also influenced by the sensorimotor costs, such that participants were more likely to choose the safe option (despite this decreasing expected gain) when the high reward target (worth twice as many points) was further. We found gender differences whereby women were less likely to reach for the …",

Recent studies have suggested that the use of electroencephalography-based brain-computer interfaces (BCI) can promote this process. Here, we report the first systematic examination of the literature on the use of BCI-robot systems for the rehabilitation of fine motor skills associated with hand movement and profile these systems from a technical and clinical perspective. A search for January 2010–October 2019 articles using Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, PEDro, PsycINFO, IEEE Xplore and Cochrane Library databases was performed. The selection criteria included BCI-hand robotic systems for rehabilitation at different stages of development involving tests on healthy participants or people who have had a stroke. Data fields include those related to study design, participant characteristics, technical specifications of the system, and clinical outcome measures. 30 studies were identified as eligible for qualitative review and among these, 11 studies involved testing a BCI-hand robot on chronic and subacute stroke patients. Statistically significant improvements in motor assessment scores relative to controls were observed for three BCI-hand robot interventions. The degree of robot control for the majority of studies was limited to triggering the device to perform grasping or pinching movements using motor imagery. Most employed a combination of kinaesthetic and visual response via the robotic device and display screen, respectively, to match feedback to motor imagery. 19 out of 30 studies on BCI-robotic systems for hand rehabilitation report systems at prototype or pre …",

The results of the discussion were translated into a list of user requirements for wearable robots in neurorehabilitation. After which, corresponding importance ratings from both the design engineers and their medical collaborators were assigned to arrive with a matrix that determines the final design priorities and specifications of the device.

Among the methods to attain sustainability discussed in this paper include compliance with university and government protocols, research ethics considerations, proper use of resources, and waste management. The project follows the triple bottom line framework for sustainability to ensure a positive social, environmental, and economical research impact.

        "abstract": "We recently found that older adults show reduced learning rates when learning a new pattern of coordinated rhythmic movement. The purpose of this study was to extend that finding by examining the performance of all ages across the lifespan from the 20 s through to the 80 s to determine how learning rates change with age. We tested whether adults could learn to produce a novel coordinated rhythmic movement (90° relative phase) in a visually guided unimanual task. We determined learning rates to quantify changes in learning with age and to determine at what ages the changes occur. We found, as before, that learning rates of participants in their 70 s and 80 s were half those of participants in their 20 s. We also found a gradual slow decline in learning rate with age until approximately age 50, when there was a sudden drop to a reduced learning rate for the 60 though 80 year olds. We discuss possible causes for the “50 s cliff” in perceptuo-motor learning rates and suggest that age related deficits in perception of complex motions may be the key to understanding this result.",

Here we investigate the differences between young and older adults in a bimanual reaching task where the goal is to bring two objects together to the same location with a synchronous placement. Older (mean age 74) and young (mean age 20) adults were asked to pick up two spatially disparate objects, one in each hand, and bring them together to place them in one of three trays laid out in front of them from left to right. The results showed that the older adults were no more detrimentally affected than the young by asymmetric bimanual movements compared to symmetric ones, and both groups completed their movements in the same time. Nevertheless, compared to the young, the older adult group produced reaches characterised by higher peak velocities (although this effect was marginal), shorter hover times, and where the movement distance varied for each hand the scaling of the kinematic profile across the two limbs diverged from that found with younger participants. They then spent longer than the young in the final adjustment phase and during this phase they made more adjustments than the young, and as a result were more synchronous in terms of the final placement of the objects. It seems that the older adults produced reach movements that were designed to reach the vicinity of the tray quite rapidly, after which time they made discreet adjustments to their initial trajectories in order to exercise the precision necessary to place the objects in the tray. These findings are consistent with the idea that …",

        "abstract": "Attention underpins many activities integral to a child’s development. However, methodological limitations currently make large-scale assessment of children’s attentional skill impractical, costly and lacking in ecological validity. Consequently we developed a measure of ‘Visual Motor Attention’ (VMA)—a construct defined as the ability to sustain and adapt visuomotor behaviour in response to task-relevant visual information. In a series of experiments, we evaluated the capability of our method to measure attentional processes and their contributions in guiding visuomotor behaviour. Experiment 1 established the method’s core features (ability to track stimuli moving on a tablet-computer screen with a hand-held stylus) and demonstrated its sensitivity to principled manipulations in adults’ attentional load. Experiment 2 standardised a format suitable for use with children and showed construct validity by capturing developmental changes in executive attention processes. Experiment 3 tested the hypothesis that children with and without coordination difficulties would show qualitatively different response patterns, finding an interaction between the cognitive and motor factors underpinning responses. Experiment 4 identified associations between VMA performance and existing standardised attention assessments and thereby confirmed convergent validity. These results establish a novel approach to measuring childhood attention that can produce meaningful functional assessments that capture how attention operates in an ecologically valid context (i.e. attention's specific contribution to visuomanual action).",

Prehension, the ability to reach-grasp-and-manipulate objects, is one of the most important human capabilities. Numerous activities of daily living (dressing, feeding, cleaning etc.) rely on dexterity, so it is perhaps unsurprising that impairment of prehension (through illness, injury or ageing decline) is often associated with disability.

Pharmacological interventions constitute the first-line treatment for TN, with antiepileptic drugs commonly prescribed. People treated for TN pain with antiepileptic drugs describe cognitive and motor difficulties affecting activities of daily living, and report poorer quality of life. We undertook the first comprehensive objective evaluation of sensorimotor and cognitive performance in participants being treated for TN pain with antiepileptic drugs relative to age-matched controls. Participants (43 TN, 41 control) completed a battery of sensorimotor (steering, aiming and tracking) and cognitive (working memory, processing speed, inhibition) tasks. The TN group performed significantly worse than controls on the sensorimotor tracking and aiming tasks and across all cognitive measures. The data explain why patients treated with antiepileptic drugs report impairment when conducting activities of daily living (given the need for cognitive and motor capability within most of these). The study is an important first step in: (i) ensuring there is adequate information on the impact of pharmacological treatment; (ii) identifying measures to determine optimal medication dosage and track change over time; (iii) creating an evidence base that could allow scientific justification of alternative pain treatment options for TN (e.g. the costs/benefits of surgery).",

        "abstract": "The duration of reach-to-grasp movements is influenced by the size of the contact surfaces, such that grasping objects with smaller contact surface areas takes longer. But what is the influence of asymmetric contact surfaces? In Experiment 1a, participants reached-to-lift wooden blocks off a table top, with the contact locations for the thumb and index finger varying in surface size. The time taken to lift the block was driven primarily by the thumb contact surface, which showed a larger effect size for the dependent variable of movement duration than the index finger’s contact surface. In Experiment 1b participants reached-to-grasp (but not lift) the blocks. The same effect was found with duration being largely driven by contact surface size for the thumb. Experiment 2 tested whether this finding generalised to movements towards conical frusta grasped in a different plane mounted off the table top. Experiment 2 showed that movement duration again was dictated primarily by the size of the thumb’s contact surface. The thumb contact surface was the visible surface in experiments 1 and 2 so Experiment 3 explored grasping when the index finger’s contact surface was visible (participants grasped the frusta with the index finger at the top). An interaction between thumb and finger surface size was now found to determine movement duration. These findings provide the first empirical report of the impact of asymmetric contact surfaces on prehension, and may have implications for scientists who wish to model reach-to-grasp behaviours.",

To date little research has been undertaken to investigate control strategies of arm/hand movements following cervical spinal cord injury (cSCI). This study aimed to investigate unimanual and bimanual coordination in patients with acute cSCI using 3D kinematic analysis as they performed naturalistic reach to grasp actions with one hand, or with both hands together (symmetrical task), and compare this to the movement patterns of uninjured younger and older adults. Eighteen adults with a cSCI (mean 61.61 years) with lesions at C4-C8, with an American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) grade B to D and 16 uninjured younger adults (mean 23.68 years) and sixteen uninjured older adults (mean 70.92 years) were recruited. Participants with a cSCI produced reach-to-grasp actions which took longer, were slower, and had longer deceleration phases than uninjured participants. These differences were exacerbated during bimanual reach-to-grasp tasks. Maximal grasp aperture was no different between groups, but reached earlier by people with cSCI. Participants with a cSCI were less synchronous than younger and older adults but all groups used the deceleration phase for error correction to end the movement in a synchronous fashion. Overall, this study suggests that after cSCI a level of bimanual coordination is retained.

For instance, astronauts learn to maneuver in zero gravity and skydivers learn to precisely control falling with the poise of an acrobat. The same learning is evident in everyday life, as people regularly adjust for the small changes to their movements caused by articles of clothing, such as the additional weight of a watch on the forearm or the differences in gait necessary for many types of shoes. In motor learning research, it has been an open question whether learning a new skill, such as the controlled fall from skydiving, is the same as altering an existing motor skill, such as reaching, to compensate for the weight of a watch. In my dissertation work I have focused on the question of how and why people alter their existing motor skills, a type of learning called adaptation.Adaptation is a specific subset of motor learning that occurs when the sensory outcome of motor commands is systematically altered. In order to induce this adaptation in the laboratory, we manipulate the visual feedback that human participants see when they are performing reaching tasks. It is thought that this type of learning, visuomotor adaptation, is driven by the difference between the feedback that was predicted to occur and the actual feedback. This discrepancy in feedback is known as a sensory prediction error. If present, these errors indicate that the sensorimotor system is not properly calibrated, and future motor commands (and their predicted sensory outcomes) are adjusted to …",

If similar environmental changes are encountered in the future, learning may be faster, a phenomenon known as savings. In studies of sensorimotor learning, a central component of savings is attributed to the explicit recall of the task structure and appropriate compensatory strategies. Whether implicit adaptation also contributes to savings remains subject to debate. We tackled this question by measuring, in parallel, explicit and implicit adaptive responses in a visuomotor rotation task, employing a protocol that typically elicits savings. While the initial rate of learning was faster in the second exposure to the perturbation, an analysis decomposing the 2 processes showed the benefit to be solely associated with explicit re-aiming. Surprisingly, we found a significant decrease after relearning in aftereffect magnitudes during no-feedback trials, a direct measure of implicit adaptation. In a second experiment, we isolated implicit adaptation using clamped visual feedback, a method known to eliminate the contribution of explicit learning processes. Consistent with the results of the first experiment, participants exhibited a marked reduction in the adaptation function, as well as an attenuated aftereffect when relearning from the clamped feedback. Motivated by these results, we reanalyzed data from prior studies and observed a consistent, yet unappreciated pattern of attenuation of implicit adaptation during relearning.

Here we offer a survey and synthesis of recent work on visuomotor adaptation that we hope will prove illuminating for this ongoing dialogue. We discuss three types of error signals that drive learning in adaptation tasks: task performance error, sensory prediction-error, and a binary target hitting error. Each of these errors has been shown to drive distinct learning processes. Namely, both target hitting errors and putative sensory prediction-errors drive an implicit change in visuomotor maps, while task performance error drives learning of explicit strategy use and non-motor decision-making. Each of these learning processes contributes to the overall learning that takes place in visuomotor adaptation tasks, and although the learning processes and error signals are independent, they interact in a complex manner. We outline many task contexts where the operation of these processes is counter-intuitive and offer general guidelines for their control, measurement and interpretation. We believe this new framework unifies several disparate threads of research in sensorimotor adaptation that often seem in conflict. We conclude by explaining how this more nuanced understanding of errors and learning processes could lend itself to the analysis of other types of sensorimotor adaptation, of motor skill learning, of the neural processing underlying sensorimotor adaptation in humans, of animal models and of brain computer interfaces.",
