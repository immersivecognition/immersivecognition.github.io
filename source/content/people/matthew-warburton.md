# Profile

I gained my Mechanical Engineering MEng from the University of Leeds in 2016. I worked in industry as a design engineer for a company designing automation machinery, before returning to academia as a research assisstant. I then started my PhD in 2019. 

# Research interests

I joined the lab due to my interest in virtual reality and how it can be used to study behaviour, and worked on the Human-Like Computing project where we investigated how humans navigate cluttered environments.
I am interested in behaviour where motor control and decision-making meet, and have investigated this using a variety of methods, including virtual reality and online experiments.
