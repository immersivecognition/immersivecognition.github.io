# Profile
I am a Teaching Fellow in Psychology and module leader for Perception. I gained my PhD at the University of Hull using brain stimulation (Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation) to reduceitch intensity. After my PhD I worked in the Education Department at the University of York, teaching Research Methods in Psychology. I have also worked part-time as an Associate Lecturer for the Open University in Cognitive and Biological Psychology since 2016.

Prior to completing my PhD I gained my MRes in Psychology and my BA in Sociology with Social Psychology, at the University of York. My MRes research focused on exploring the role of Brocaâ€™s area in early access to phonological information using MEG (Magnetoencephalography).
