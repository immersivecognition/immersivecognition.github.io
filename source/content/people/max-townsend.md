# Profile

I have long been obsessed with intelligent systems, and how they can arise from computational processes. I started out my academic career by learning about naturally constructed intelligent systems (primarily humans) through pursuing an undergraduate degree in Psychology. Captured by the allure of investigating intelligence in much more readily formalisable systems, I undertook a MSc in Computer Science, where I could view learning and intelligence through very different frameworks. I felt that statistical methods for producing artificial intelligent systems may never achieve the generality of computation which is observed in humans. This feeling has led me to pursue a PhD in Psychology, where I hope to uncover general computational rules in humans; specifically in cognitive processes recruited during motor learning and adaptation tasks (which likely extrapolate much more broadly across task space). Ultimately, I hope to to be able to fromally construct a system which lives up to the (bounded) generality of computational processes found in human cognition. 

# Research interests

My interests overlap with Cognitive Science, Computer Science, and Artificial Intelligence. My PhD focusses on sensorimotor adaptation in humans; specifically, I am interested in the cognitive learning and decision making processes recruited alongside the sensorimotor system. I believe that these processes play a crucial role in adaptation tasks, and are responsible for much behaviour which has traditionally been considered a product solely of the motor system. Beyond this, the fundamental computations/transition rules at play should be generally applicable across much of the region of computational space in which intelligent behaviour and learning reside. This set of general rules should be formalisable, where, ultimately, I hope to see them empower artifical systems to operate as generally as humans.
