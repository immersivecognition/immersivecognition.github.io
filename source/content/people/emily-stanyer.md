# Profile
I joined the University of Leeds after completing a master's in psychology from the University of York.

# Research interests
My research interests lie in the field of sleep. I use electrophysiological methods (EEG) to measure brain activity during sleep and correlate this with next day performance on cognitive tasks. I am currently involved in developing wireless polysomnography (PSG) to deliver sound stimulation during slow-wave sleep.
