# Profile
Dr Faisal Mushtaq is a cognitive neuroscience, whose research examines interactions between action and cognition in human reinforcement learning and decision-making. 

Dr Mushtaq is currently a University Academic Fellow in Health Engineering at the University of Leeds and holds a Turing Institute Fellowship. He also leads the Immersive Cognition (ICON) Research Group and is Associate Director of the Centre for Immersive Technologies at the University of Leeds. 

# Responsibilities
* Associate Director, Centre for Immersive Technologies
* Alan Turing Institute Fellow

# Research interests

Mushtaq's research sits at the interface between psychology, engineering and computer science and takes a multi-modal approach to understanding the relationship between action and cognition; from capturing neural activity (primarily EEG) and behavioural markers of performance using Virtual and Augmented Reality technology in laboratory-controlled environments through to extracting measures of performance in the real world from large-scale datasets. Mushtaq has also been driving forward the application of principles from cognitive science to real world contexts to accelerate the acquisition of skilled behaviour - from surgeons performing minimally invasive surgery through to facilitating human-like decision-making in robots.
