# Fruitbat Splat

Fruitbat splat is a browser-based task designed to assess reactive and proactive inhibition in the context of timed interception. 
At night, it is safe to leave the cave and collect the fruit that flies over head. 
At sunrise it is also safe, but if there is a spontaneous sunrise and the bat is caught outside, it will burn to a crisp.

Cannon Game is a model environment for isolating the more cognitive processes at play during sensorimotor adaptation tasks. 
This environment allows us to lift the cognitive component up, out of the motor context, while providing full control over execution noise and (exogenous) implicit learning. 
Ultimately, this should yield a model of non-motor learning and decision making, such that we can transfer it back into the motor context to constrain the space of behavioural variance associated with the motor system and better understand motor adaptation.

# Turbo Typing

Turbo Typing is a longitudinal online study where school pupils progress through a purpose-built touch typing course and intermittently complete a series of tasks. 
The tasks are designed to tap into different 'sub-skills' of typing, such as how many keystrokes in advance of the current keystroke have already been planned out. 
This enables us to assess in detail how the skill of touch typing is acquired.

# Race Across Space

Race Across Space aims to understand how people perform in computer games when their movements control the game by either moving their cursor on the screen or rotating the view of the game like in first-person shooter games.
This will serve as a springboard from which we can study different aspects of motor learning, including the sub-skills that develop to make one an expert gamer.
