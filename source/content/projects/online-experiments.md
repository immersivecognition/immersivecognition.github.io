# Studying Human Behaviour Online



## Fruitbat Splat

Fruitbat splat is a browser-based task designed to assess reactive and proactive inhibition in the context of timed interception. 
At night, it is safe to leave the cave and collect the fruit that flies over head. 
At sunrise it is also safe, but if the sun comes out, the bat will burn to a crisp.

## Turbo Typing

Turbo Typing is a longitudinal online study where school pupils progress through a purpose-built touch typing course and intermittently complete a series of tasks. 
The tasks are designed to tap into different 'sub-skills' of typing, such as how many keystrokes in advance of the current keystroke have already been planned out. 
This enables us to assess in detail how the skill of touch typing is acquired.

## Race Across Space

Race Across Space aims to understand how people perform in computer games when their movements control the game by either moving their cursor on the screen or rotating the view of the game like in first-person shooter games.
This will serve as a springboard from which we can study different aspects of motor learning, including the sub-skills that develop to make one an expert gamer.
